If	1	1
you	2	1
were	3	1
to	4	1
journey	5	1
to	6	1
the	7	1
North	8	1
of	9	1
England,	10	1
you	11	1
would	12	1
come	13	1
to	14	1
a	15	1
valley	16	1
that	17	1
is	18	1
surrounded	19	1
by	20	1
moors	21	1
as	22	1
high	23	1
as	24	1
mountains.	25	1
It	26	1
is	27	1
in	28	1
this	29	1
valley	30	1
where	31	1
you	32	1
would	33	1
find	34	1
the	35	1
city	36	1
of	37	1
Bradford,	38	1
where	39	1
once	40	1
a	41	1
thousand	42	1
spinning	43	1
jennies	44	1
that	45	1
hummed	46	1
and	47	1
clattered	48	1
spun	49	1
wool	50	1
into	51	1
money	52	1
for	53	1
the	54	1
long-bearded	55	1
mill	56	1
owners.	57	1
That	58	1
all	59	1
mill	60	1
owners	61	1
were	62	1
generally	63	1
busy	64	1
as	65	1
beavers	66	1
and	67	1
quite	68	1
pleased	69	1
with	70	1
themselves	71	1
for	72	1
being	73	1
so	74	1
successful	75	1
and	76	1
well	77	1
off	78	1
was	79	1
known	80	1
to	81	1
the	82	1
residents	83	1
of	84	1
Bradford,	85	1
and	86	1
if	87	1
you	88	1
were	89	1
to	90	1
go	91	1
into	92	1
the	93	1
city	94	1
to	95	1
visit	96	1
the	97	1
stately	98	1
City	99	1
Hall,	100	1
you	101	1
would	102	1
see	103	1
there	104	1
the	105	1
Crest	106	1
of	107	1
the	108	1
City	109	1
of	110	1
Bradford,	111	1
which	112	1
those	113	1
same	114	1
mill	115	1
owners	116	1
created	117	1
to	118	1
celebrate	119	1
their	120	1
achievements.	121	1
It	122	1
shows	123	1
a	124	1
sinister	125	1
looking	126	1
boar's	127	1
head	128	1
sitting	129	1
on	130	1
top	131	1
of	132	1
a	133	1
well	134	1
which	135	1
seems	136	1
puzzling	137	1
at	138	1
first,	139	1
but	140	1
the	141	1
reason	142	1
for	143	1
this	144	1
symbol	145	1
is	146	1
a	147	1
matter	148	1
of	149	1
legend.	150	1
There	151	1
was	152	1
once,	153	1
legend	154	1
has	155	1
it,	156	1
a	157	1
fearsome	158	1
boar,	159	1
which	160	1
lived	161	1
in	162	1
a	163	1
wood	164	1
located	165	1
just	166	1
outside	167	1
the	168	1
manor	169	1
of	170	1
Bradford.	171	1
A	172	1
source	173	1
of	174	1
great	175	1
trouble	176	1
to	177	1
the	178	1
local	179	1
folk	180	1
the	181	1
boar	182	1
was,	183	1
bringing	184	1
terror	185	1
to	186	1
the	187	1
peaceful	188	1
flocks	189	1
and	190	1
ravaging	191	1
the	192	1
countryside	193	1
around.	194	1
Even	195	1
worse,	196	1
however,	197	1
the	198	1
boar	199	1
most	200	1
liked	201	1
to	202	1
go	203	1
to	204	1
the	205	1
well	206	1
that	207	1
was	208	1
in	209	1
the	210	1
wood	211	1
and	212	1
drink	213	1
its	214	1
fresh	215	1
water,	216	1
so	217	1
that	218	1
the	219	1
people	220	1
of	221	1
Bradford	222	1
had	223	1
second	224	1
thoughts	225	1
about	226	1
visiting	227	1
the	228	1
well.	229	1
That	230	1
the	231	1
people	232	1
of	233	1
Bradford	234	1
bore	235	1
the	236	1
brunt	237	1
of	238	1
the	239	1
beast's	240	1
ferocity	241	1
was	242	1
unfair	243	1
in	244	1
the	245	1
eyes	246	1
of	247	1
the	248	1
people	249	1
of	250	1
the	251	1
region.	252	1
Eventually,	253	1
the	254	1
issue	255	1
reached	256	1
the	257	1
ears	258	1
of	259	1
the	260	1
kindly	261	1
Lord	262	1
of	263	1
the	264	1
Manor	265	1
who	266	1
the	267	1
people	268	1
had	269	1
often	270	1
asked	271	1
for	272	1
help.	273	1
The	274	1
Lord	275	1
saw	276	1
the	277	1
severity	278	1
of	279	1
the	280	1
problem	281	1
the	282	1
people	283	1
faced	284	1
and	285	1
suggested	286	1
a	287	1
contest	288	1
could	289	1
solve	290	1
the	291	1
problem.	292	1
He	293	1
said	294	1
that	295	1
whoever	296	1
could	297	1
kill	298	1
the	299	1
boar	300	1
and	301	1
bring	302	1
as	303	1
proof	304	1
its	305	1
head	306	1
to	307	1
the	308	1
Manor	309	1
House	310	1
would	311	1
be	312	1
rewarded	313	1
with	314	1
land	315	1
and	316	1
fame.	317	1
It	318	1
was	319	1
the	320	1
people	321	1
of	322	1
Bradford	323	1
and	324	1
the	325	1
people	326	1
who	327	1
knew	328	1
them	329	1
who	330	1
rejoiced	331	1
at	332	1
this	333	1
proclamation	334	1
but	335	1
one	336	1
question	337	1
remained:	338	1
who	339	1
would	340	1
kill	341	1
the	342	1
boar?	343	1
By	344	1
the	345	1
handsome	346	1
reward	347	1
many	348	1
felt	349	1
tempted,	350	1
but	351	1
the	352	1
thought	353	1
of	354	1
the	355	1
boar	356	1
with	357	1
its	358	1
deadly	359	1
tusks	360	1
and	361	1
face	362	1
like	363	1
thunder	364	1
soon	365	1
put	366	1
an	367	1
end	368	1
to	369	1
their	370	1
ambitions.	371	1
However,	372	1
there	373	1
was	374	1
one	375	1
huntsman,	376	1
who	377	1
was	378	1
still	379	1
wet	380	1
behind	381	1
the	382	1
ears,	383	1
who	384	1
decided	385	1
the	386	1
prize	387	1
was	388	1
worth	389	1
a	390	1
shot,	391	1
in	392	1
spite	393	1
of	394	1
the	395	1
boar's	396	1
reputation.	397	1
The	398	1
huntsman	399	1
discovered	400	1
the	401	1
boar	402	1
preferred	403	1
to	404	1
come	405	1
out	406	1
in	407	1
the	408	1
middle	409	1
of	410	1
the	411	1
day.	412	1
So	413	1
he	414	1
went	415	1
to	416	1
the	417	1
wood	418	1
by	419	1
the	420	1
well	421	1
with	422	1
his	423	1
good	424	1
bow,	425	1
to	426	1
bide	427	1
his	428	1
time.	429	1
Around	430	1
noontime,	431	1
the	432	1
boar,	433	1
feared	434	1
by	435	1
the	436	1
locals,	437	1
came	438	1
out,	439	1
as	440	1
slow	441	1
as	442	1
a	443	1
snail,	444	1
from	445	1
among	446	1
the	447	1
trees,	448	1
just	449	1
as	450	1
the	451	1
huntsman	452	1
had	453	1
predicted.	454	1
The	455	1
huntsman	456	1
leaped	457	1
from	458	1
his	459	1
hiding	460	1
place	461	1
and	462	1
through	463	1
the	464	1
heart	465	1
with	466	1
his	467	1
fine	468	1
arrows	469	1
shot	470	1
the	471	1
boar.	472	1
Now	473	1
the	474	1
problem	475	1
was	476	1
no	477	1
longer	478	1
to	479	1
kill	480	1
the	481	1
boar.	482	1
It	483	1
was	484	1
to	485	1
find	486	1
a	487	1
way	488	1
to	489	1
carry	490	1
the	491	1
boar	492	1
back.	493	1
The	494	1
head	495	1
was	496	1
too	497	1
heavy	498	1
for	499	1
the	500	1
little	501	1
huntsman	502	1
to	503	1
carry	504	1
back	505	1
to	506	1
the	507	1
Manor	508	1
House,	509	1
but	510	1
the	511	1
huntsman,	512	1
who	513	1
was	514	1
as	515	1
quick-witted	516	1
and	517	1
cunning	518	1
as	519	1
ever,	520	1
asked	521	1
himself,	522	1
'What	523	1
else	524	1
can	525	1
I	526	1
do	527	1
to	528	1
prove	529	1
I	530	1
killed	531	1
the	532	1
boar?'	533	1
The	534	1
next	535	1
instance	536	1
he	537	1
opened	538	1
the	539	1
boar's	540	1
mouth	541	1
and	542	1
cut	543	1
out	544	1
its	545	1
tongue,	546	1
taking	547	1
that	548	1
as	549	1
proof	550	1
for	551	1
the	552	1
Lord.	553	1
He	554	1
set	555	1
out	556	1
for	557	1
the	558	1
Manor	559	1
House	560	1
as	561	1
quickly	562	1
as	563	1
he	564	1
could	565	1
and	566	1
he	567	1
had	568	1
only	569	1
been	570	1
gone	571	1
a	572	1
few	573	1
minutes	574	1
when	575	1
a	576	1
second	577	1
huntsman,	578	1
not	579	1
so	580	1
bold	581	1
as	582	1
the	583	1
first	584	1
but	585	1
a	586	1
little	587	1
more	588	1
cunning,	589	1
came	590	1
on	591	1
the	592	1
scene.	593	1
Seeing	594	1
the	595	1
slain	596	1
carcass	597	1
of	598	1
the	599	1
boar,	600	1
the	601	1
huntsman	602	1
rejoiced	603	1
in	604	1
his	605	1
good	606	1
fortune.	607	1
The	608	1
second	609	1
huntsman	610	1
knew	611	1
a	612	1
shortcut	613	1
to	614	1
the	615	1
Manor	616	1
House	617	1
was	618	1
just	619	1
around	620	1
the	621	1
nearby	622	1
pond,	623	1
and,	624	1
being	625	1
a	626	1
bigger	627	1
man	628	1
than	629	1
the	630	1
first,	631	1
was	632	1
able	633	1
to	634	1
pick	635	1
up	636	1
the	637	1
boar's	638	1
head	639	1
and	640	1
carry	641	1
it	642	1
through	643	1
the	644	1
wood	645	1
towards	646	1
the	647	1
prize	648	1
that	649	1
awaited	650	1
him.	651	1
The	652	1
Lord	653	1
of	654	1
the	655	1
Manor	656	1
was	657	1
seated	658	1
in	659	1
his	660	1
hall	661	1
when	662	1
the	663	1
second	664	1
huntsman	665	1
burst	666	1
through	667	1
the	668	1
door	669	1
and	670	1
began	671	1
to	672	1
spin	673	1
a	674	1
line.	675	1
'The	676	1
woes	677	1
of	678	1
Bradford	679	1
are	680	1
ended!'	681	1
he	682	1
announced.	683	1
'With	684	1
my	685	1
own	686	1
hand	687	1
I	688	1
have	689	1
slain	690	1
the	691	1
boar!'	692	1
And,	693	1
with	694	1
that,	695	1
at	696	1
the	697	1
feet	698	1
of	699	1
his	700	1
lord	701	1
he	702	1
dropped	703	1
the	704	1
boar's	705	1
enormous	706	1
head.	707	1
'Then	708	1
you	709	1
will	710	1
be	711	1
rewarded,	712	1
as	713	1
I	714	1
promised.'	715	1
'But	716	1
first,	717	1
let	718	1
me	719	1
examine	720	1
the	721	1
head	722	1
of	723	1
this	724	1
monster,'	725	1
said	726	1
the	727	1
Lord	728	1
of	729	1
the	730	1
Manor.	731	1
To	732	1
not	733	1
examine	734	1
the	735	1
head	736	1
in	737	1
advance	738	1
had	739	1
not	740	1
been	741	1
very	742	1
clever	743	1
on	744	1
the	745	1
part	746	1
of	747	1
the	748	1
huntsman.	749	1
Right	750	1
away,	751	1
the	752	1
Lord	753	1
noticed	754	1
the	755	1
tongue	756	1
of	757	1
the	758	1
boar	759	1
was	760	1
missing	761	1
and	762	1
exclaimed,	763	1
'What	764	1
is	765	1
this?	766	1
A	767	1
boar	768	1
with	769	1
no	770	1
tongue?'	771	1
He	772	1
looked	773	1
at	774	1
the	775	1
huntsman,	776	1
dubiously.	777	1
'How	778	1
come	779	1
this	780	1
creature	781	1
has	782	1
no	783	1
tongue?'	784	1
he	785	1
demanded.	786	1
All	787	1
eyes	788	1
were	789	1
on	790	1
the	791	1
huntsman.	792	1
The	793	1
huntsman	794	1
questioned	795	1
by	796	1
the	797	1
Lord	798	1
replied,	799	1
'I	800	1
cannot	801	1
say,	802	1
my	803	1
Lord.'	804	1
He	805	1
was	806	1
suddenly	807	1
realizing	808	1
his	809	1
tricky	810	1
situation	811	1
could	812	1
end	813	1
badly	814	1
for	815	1
him.	816	1
Through	817	1
the	818	1
door	819	1
at	820	1
this	821	1
moment,	822	1
the	823	1
first	824	1
huntsman	825	1
burst.	826	1
'The	827	1
woes	828	1
of	829	1
Bradford	830	1
are	831	1
ended!'	832	1
he	833	1
cried.	834	1
'I	835	1
have	836	1
slain	837	1
the	838	1
boar	839	1
the	840	1
people	841	1
of	842	1
Bradford	843	1
dreaded!'	844	1
All	845	1
eyes	846	1
turned	847	1
to	848	1
the	849	1
man	850	1
who	851	1
now	852	1
stood	853	1
in	854	1
the	855	1
doorway.	856	1
'The	857	1
reward	858	1
is	859	1
already	860	1
given,'	861	1
said	862	1
the	863	1
Lord	864	1
of	865	1
the	866	1
Manor.	867	1
'The	868	1
man	869	1
here	870	1
has	871	1
brought	872	1
to	873	1
me	874	1
the	875	1
boar's	876	1
head.'	877	1
'Then	878	1
where	879	1
is	880	1
its	881	1
tongue?'	882	1
the	883	1
first	884	1
huntsman	885	1
replied.	886	1
And,	887	1
so	888	1
saying,	889	1
he	890	1
drew	891	1
out	892	1
the	893	1
boar's	894	1
tongue	895	1
he	896	1
had	897	1
put	898	1
in	899	1
his	900	1
hunting	901	1
pouch	902	1
and	903	1
related	904	1
how	905	1
he	906	1
had	907	1
ambushed	908	1
the	909	1
creature	910	1
in	911	1
the	912	1
wood	913	1
and	914	1
cut	915	1
out	916	1
its	917	1
tongue	918	1
as	919	1
proof	920	1
of	921	1
his	922	1
victory.	923	1
Listening	924	1
to	925	1
the	926	1
tale,	927	1
the	928	1
Lord	929	1
of	930	1
the	931	1
Manor	932	1
tried	933	1
to	934	1
discern	935	1
which	936	1
huntsman	937	1
was	938	1
telling	939	1
him	940	1
the	941	1
truth	942	1
and	943	1
what	944	1
the	945	1
two	946	1
huntsmen	947	1
were	948	1
thinking	949	1
as	950	1
they	951	1
waited	952	1
for	953	1
him	954	1
to	955	1
make	956	1
a	957	1
decision.	958	1
Almost	959	1
instantly,	960	1
the	961	1
Lord	962	1
saw	963	1
that	964	1
the	965	1
second	966	1
huntsman	967	1
had	968	1
fed	969	1
him	970	1
a	971	1
pack	972	1
of	973	1
lies	974	1
and	975	1
it	976	1
was	977	1
the	978	1
first	979	1
huntsman	980	1
who	981	1
was	982	1
the	983	1
true	984	1
savior	985	1
of	986	1
Bradford.	987	1
The	988	1
Lord	989	1
believed	990	1
the	991	1
second	992	1
huntsman	993	1
had	994	1
tried	995	1
to	996	1
steal	997	1
the	998	1
first	999	1
huntsman's	1000	1
prize	1001	1
and	1002	1
so	1003	1
proclaimed	1004	1
the	1005	1
first	1006	1
huntsman	1007	1
the	1008	1
true	1009	1
victor.	1010	1
The	1011	1
Lord	1012	1
wondered	1013	1
for	1014	1
a	1015	1
moment	1016	1
why	1017	1
he	1018	1
always	1019	1
encountered	1020	1
so	1021	1
much	1022	1
chicanery	1023	1
in	1024	1
his	1025	1
everyday	1026	1
interactions.	1027	1
The	1028	1
huntsman	1029	1
who	1030	1
had	1031	1
earned	1032	1
his	1033	1
prize	1034	1
fair	1035	1
and	1036	1
square	1037	1
received	1038	1
as	1039	1
his	1040	1
reward	1041	1
a	1042	1
piece	1043	1
of	1044	1
land	1045	1
just	1046	1
outside	1047	1
the	1048	1
town,	1049	1
known	1050	1
thereafter	1051	1
as	1052	1
Hunt	1053	1
Yard.	1054	1
His	1055	1
fame	1056	1
was	1057	1
indeed	1058	1
assured,	1059	1
but	1060	1
it	1061	1
was	1062	1
not	1063	1
nearly	1064	1
as	1065	1
lasting	1066	1
as	1067	1
that	1068	1
of	1069	1
the	1070	1
fearsome	1071	1
Bradford	1072	1
Boar.	1073	1
A	1	2
clear	2	2
and	3	2
joyous	4	2
day	5	2
it	6	2
was	7	2
and	8	2
out	9	2
on	10	2
the	11	2
wide	12	2
open	13	2
sea,	14	2
thousands	15	2
upon	16	2
thousands	17	2
of	18	2
sparkling	19	2
water	20	2
drops,	21	2
excited	22	2
by	23	2
getting	24	2
to	25	2
play	26	2
in	27	2
the	28	2
ocean,	29	2
danced	30	2
all	31	2
around.	32	2
One	33	2
of	34	2
these	35	2
was	36	2
a	37	2
merry	38	2
little	39	2
fellow	40	2
named	41	2
Aqua,	42	2
who	43	2
danced	44	2
on	45	2
the	46	2
silver	47	2
backs	48	2
of	49	2
the	50	2
fishes	51	2
as	52	2
they	53	2
plunged	54	2
up	55	2
and	56	2
down	57	2
in	58	2
the	59	2
waves,	60	2
and,	61	2
no	62	2
matter	63	2
how	64	2
high	65	2
he	66	2
sprung,	67	2
he	68	2
always	69	2
came	70	2
down	71	2
again	72	2
into	73	2
his	74	2
mother's	75	2
lap.	76	2
His	77	2
mother,	78	2
you	79	2
know,	80	2
was	81	2
the	82	2
ocean,	83	2
and	84	2
very	85	2
beautiful	86	2
she	87	2
looked	88	2
that	89	2
summer	90	2
day	91	2
in	92	2
her	93	2
dark	94	2
blue	95	2
dress	96	2
and	97	2
white	98	2
ruffles.	99	2
By	100	2
and	101	2
by,	102	2
the	103	2
happy	104	2
water	105	2
drop	106	2
tired	107	2
of	108	2
his	109	2
play,	110	2
and	111	2
looking	112	2
up	113	2
to	114	2
the	115	2
clear	116	2
sky	117	2
above	118	2
him,	119	2
thought	120	2
he	121	2
would	122	2
like	123	2
to	124	2
have	125	2
a	126	2
sail	127	2
on	128	2
one	129	2
of	130	2
the	131	2
white,	132	2
marshmallow-like	133	2
clouds,	134	2
instead	135	2
of	136	2
spending	137	2
his	138	2
whole	139	2
life	140	2
in	141	2
the	142	2
ocean.	143	2
Of	144	2
the	145	2
sky,	146	2
little	147	2
Aqua	148	2
had	149	2
always	150	2
been	151	2
afraid,	152	2
but	153	2
he	154	2
decided	155	2
to	156	2
finally	157	2
face	158	2
his	159	2
demons	160	2
and	161	2
suggested	162	2
a	163	2
solution	164	2
involving	165	2
the	166	2
sun	167	2
carrying	168	2
him	169	2
up	170	2
to	171	2
the	172	2
sky	173	2
would	174	2
be	175	2
ideal.	176	2
The	177	2
sun	178	2
understood	179	2
Aqua's	180	2
request	181	2
came	182	2
from	183	2
his	184	2
heart,	185	2
so	186	2
he	187	2
acquiesced	188	2
and	189	2
also	190	2
took	191	2
ever	192	2
so	193	2
many	194	2
other	195	2
drops,	196	2
so	197	2
that	198	2
Aqua	199	2
might	200	2
not	201	2
be	202	2
lonesome	203	2
on	204	2
the	205	2
way.	206	2
It	207	2
was	208	2
only	209	2
the	210	2
sun	211	2
that	212	2
knew	213	2
this,	214	2
however,	215	2
for	216	2
all	217	2
the	218	2
other	219	2
drops	220	2
had	221	2
been	222	2
changed	223	2
into	224	2
fine	225	2
mist	226	2
or	227	2
vapor	228	2
and	229	2
Aqua	230	2
could	231	2
not	232	2
see	233	2
them.	234	2
Do	235	2
you	236	2
know	237	2
what	238	2
vapor	239	2
is?	240	2
If	241	2
you	242	2
breathe	243	2
into	244	2
the	245	2
air,	246	2
when	247	2
it	248	2
is	249	2
cold	250	2
enough,	251	2
you	252	2
will	253	2
see	254	2
it	255	2
coming	256	2
out	257	2
of	258	2
your	259	2
mouth	260	2
thick	261	2
and	262	2
fast	263	2
like	264	2
steam.	265	2
When	266	2
the	267	2
vapor	268	2
is	269	2
quite	270	2
near	271	2
the	272	2
earth,	273	2
we	274	2
call	275	2
it	276	2
'fog'.	277	2
Into	278	2
vapor	279	2
the	280	2
water	281	2
drops	282	2
that	283	2
danced	284	2
in	285	2
the	286	2
ocean	287	2
had	288	2
been	289	2
changed,	290	2
because	291	2
in	292	2
their	293	2
own	294	2
shape	295	2
they	296	2
were	297	2
too	298	2
heavy	299	2
for	300	2
the	301	2
sunbeams	302	2
that	303	2
the	304	2
sun	305	2
let	306	2
out	307	2
to	308	2
carry.	309	2
Higher	310	2
and	311	2
higher	312	2
they	313	2
sailed,	314	2
and	315	2
though	316	2
it	317	2
was	318	2
grand,	319	2
Aqua	320	2
and	321	2
his	322	2
friends	323	2
were	324	2
like	325	2
fish	326	2
out	327	2
of	328	2
water,	329	2
so	330	2
they	331	2
grew	332	2
quite	333	2
dizzy.	334	2
They	335	2
enjoyed	336	2
looking	337	2
down	338	2
on	339	2
the	340	2
world	341	2
below,	342	2
while	343	2
the	344	2
wind	345	2
scattered	346	2
them	347	2
across	348	2
the	349	2
four	350	2
corners	351	2
of	352	2
the	353	2
earth,	354	2
but	355	2
after	356	2
a	357	2
while	358	2
it	359	2
grew	360	2
nearly	361	2
time	362	2
for	363	2
the	364	2
sun	365	2
to	366	2
go	367	2
to	368	2
bed.	369	2
He	370	2
became	371	2
very	372	2
red	373	2
in	374	2
the	375	2
face,	376	2
and	377	2
began	378	2
to	379	2
sink	380	2
lower	381	2
and	382	2
lower,	383	2
until	384	2
suddenly	385	2
he	386	2
went	387	2
clear	388	2
out	389	2
of	390	2
sight!	391	2
Poor	392	2
little	393	2
Aqua,	394	2
frightened	395	2
by	396	2
the	397	2
impending	398	2
cold	399	2
and	400	2
darkness,	401	2
wished	402	2
he	403	2
could	404	2
sleep	405	2
not	406	2
in	407	2
the	408	2
sky,	409	2
but	410	2
somewhere	411	2
closer	412	2
to	413	2
earth.	414	2
Then	415	2
Aqua	416	2
heard	417	2
the	418	2
wind	419	2
blow	420	2
and	421	2
conjectured	422	2
that	423	2
maybe	424	2
the	425	2
wind	426	2
could	427	2
take	428	2
him	429	2
back	430	2
down	431	2
to	432	2
the	433	2
ocean.	434	2
Indeed,	435	2
the	436	2
wind	437	2
took	438	2
pity	439	2
on	440	2
him	441	2
and	442	2
fanned	443	2
him,	444	2
together	445	2
with	446	2
all	447	2
of	448	2
his	449	2
brothers	450	2
and	451	2
sisters,	452	2
into	453	2
a	454	2
heavy	455	2
gray	456	2
cloud,	457	2
after	458	2
which	459	2
he	460	2
blew	461	2
them	462	2
apart	463	2
and	464	2
told	465	2
them	466	2
to	467	2
hurry	468	2
down,	469	2
fast	470	2
and	471	2
furious	472	2
to	473	2
the	474	2
earth,	475	2
so	476	2
they	477	2
could	478	2
have	479	2
a	480	2
fighting	481	2
chance	482	2
of	483	2
reaching	484	2
the	485	2
ocean.	486	2
Down	487	2
they	488	2
went,	489	2
rolling	490	2
over	491	2
each	492	2
other	493	2
until	494	2
with	495	2
a	496	2
patter	497	2
and	498	2
clatter	499	2
and	500	2
spatter	501	2
they	502	2
touched	503	2
the	504	2
ground,	505	2
and	506	2
all	507	2
the	508	2
people	509	2
that	510	2
the	511	2
raindrops	512	2
fell	513	2
on	514	2
cried,	515	2
'It's	516	2
raining',	517	2
and	518	2
took	519	2
out	520	2
their	521	2
umbrellas.	522	2
Some	523	2
of	524	2
the	525	2
drops	526	2
that	527	2
were	528	2
the	529	2
most	530	2
fortunate,	531	2
including	532	2
Aqua,	533	2
fell	534	2
on	535	2
a	536	2
mountainside,	537	2
and	538	2
down	539	2
the	540	2
rocky	541	2
cliff	542	2
they	543	2
ran.	544	2
Together	545	2
they	546	2
plunged	547	2
into	548	2
a	549	2
mountain	550	2
brook,	551	2
which	552	2
came	553	2
foaming	554	2
and	555	2
dashing	556	2
along,	557	2
leaping	558	2
over	559	2
rocks	560	2
and	561	2
rushing	562	2
down	563	2
the	564	2
hillside,	565	2
until	566	2
in	567	2
the	568	2
valley	569	2
below	570	2
they	571	2
heard	572	2
the	573	2
strangest	574	2
clattering	575	2
noise.	576	2
The	577	2
little	578	2
water	579	2
drops	580	2
were	581	2
then	582	2
able	583	2
to	584	2
make	585	2
out	586	2
a	587	2
flour	588	2
mill	589	2
that	590	2
was	591	2
standing	592	2
on	593	2
the	594	2
bank.	595	2
Inside	596	2
the	597	2
mill,	598	2
the	599	2
water	600	2
drops	601	2
saw	602	2
two	603	2
great	604	2
stones,	605	2
which	606	2
the	607	2
big	608	2
wheel	609	2
kept	610	2
whizzing	611	2
round	612	2
and	613	2
round.	614	2
The	615	2
stones,	616	2
smoothed	617	2
by	618	2
the	619	2
spinning,	620	2
were	621	2
busy	622	2
grinding	623	2
the	624	2
wheat	625	2
into	626	2
flour	627	2
and	628	2
the	629	2
corn	630	2
into	631	2
golden	632	2
meal.	633	2
But	634	2
what	635	2
giant	636	2
do	637	2
you	638	2
suppose	639	2
it	640	2
was	641	2
who	642	2
could	643	2
turn	644	2
and	645	2
swing	646	2
that	647	2
tremendous	648	2
wheel?	649	2
No	650	2
giant	651	2
at	652	2
all.	653	2
It	654	2
was	655	2
just	656	2
our	657	2
tiny	658	2
little	659	2
water	660	2
drops,	661	2
who	662	2
sprang	663	2
on	664	2
it	665	2
by	666	2
hundreds	667	2
and	668	2
thousands,	669	2
and	670	2
whirled	671	2
it	672	2
over	673	2
and	674	2
over.	675	2
It	676	2
was	677	2
lucky	678	2
for	679	2
the	680	2
water	681	2
drops	682	2
that	683	2
the	684	2
brook	685	2
where	686	2
they	687	2
were	688	2
swimming	689	2
next	690	2
emptied	691	2
into	692	2
a	693	2
beautiful	694	2
pond	695	2
where	696	2
ducks	697	2
and	698	2
geese	699	2
were	700	2
living	701	2
peacefully.	702	2
Aqua	703	2
liked	704	2
to	705	2
play	706	2
hide-and-seek	707	2
in	708	2
this	709	2
pond,	710	2
and	711	2
it	712	2
was	713	2
his	714	2
brother	715	2
water	716	2
drop	717	2
who	718	2
he	719	2
fooled	720	2
by	721	2
swimming	722	2
to	723	2
a	724	2
big	725	2
pool	726	2
of	727	2
water	728	2
and	729	2
pretending	730	2
to	731	2
hide	732	2
there,	733	2
but	734	2
then	735	2
sneaking	736	2
under	737	2
a	738	2
rock	739	2
into	740	2
an	741	2
obscured	742	2
little	743	2
puddle.	744	2
His	745	2
brother	746	2
had	747	2
blatantly	748	2
peaked	749	2
and	750	2
even	751	2
followed	752	2
Aqua	753	2
as	754	2
he	755	2
entered	756	2
the	757	2
big	758	2
pool	759	2
of	760	2
water,	761	2
so	762	2
when	763	2
he	764	2
searched	765	2
there	766	2
and	767	2
could	768	2
not	769	2
find	770	2
him,	771	2
he	772	2
was	773	2
extremely	774	2
surprised	775	2
and	776	2
gave	777	2
up.	778	2
Aqua	779	2
liked	780	2
this	781	2
pond	782	2
where	783	2
he	784	2
could	785	2
play	786	2
all	787	2
day,	788	2
so	789	2
he	790	2
stayed	791	2
a	792	2
good	793	2
while,	794	2
sailing	795	2
up	796	2
and	797	2
down,	798	2
taking	799	2
the	800	2
ducks'	801	2
backs	802	2
for	803	2
ships	804	2
and	805	2
the	806	2
frogs	807	2
for	808	2
horses,	809	2
but	810	2
after	811	2
a	812	2
time	813	2
he	814	2
tired	815	2
of	816	2
the	817	2
dull	818	2
life,	819	2
and	820	2
he	821	2
and	822	2
his	823	2
brothers	824	2
floated	825	2
under	826	2
a	827	2
bridge	828	2
for	829	2
a	830	2
long	831	2
distance,	832	2
until	833	2
they	834	2
saw	835	2
another	836	2
brook	837	2
tumbling	838	2
down	839	2
a	840	2
hillside.	841	2
'Come,	842	2
let's	843	2
join	844	2
hands!'	845	2
cried	846	2
Aqua	847	2
and	848	2
because	849	2
the	850	2
water	851	2
drops	852	2
were	853	2
all	854	2
together,	855	2
overcoming	856	2
the	857	2
brook	858	2
was	859	2
child's	860	2
play.	861	2
It	862	2
was	863	2
by	864	2
the	865	2
help	866	2
of	867	2
Aqua	868	2
and	869	2
his	870	2
brothers	871	2
that	872	2
the	873	2
bewitching	874	2
river	875	2
was	876	2
able	877	2
to	878	2
float	879	2
heavy	880	2
ships,	881	2
though	882	2
not	883	2
so	884	2
long	885	2
ago	886	2
it	887	2
was	888	2
only	889	2
a	890	2
little	891	2
stream.	892	2
As	893	2
the	894	2
river	895	2
grew	896	2
wider	897	2
and	898	2
he	899	2
could	900	2
almost	901	2
see	902	2
the	903	2
ocean,	904	2
Aqua	905	2
realized	906	2
his	907	2
journey	908	2
was	909	2
almost	910	2
over	911	2
and	912	2
he	913	2
had	914	2
come	915	2
full	916	2
circle.	917	2
Back	918	2
in	919	2
the	920	2
ocean,	921	2
he	922	2
felt	923	2
right	924	2
at	925	2
home.	926	2
For	927	2
him,	928	2
this	929	2
was	930	2
the	931	2
safest,	932	2
sweetest	933	2
place	934	2
in	935	2
the	936	2
whole	937	2
wide	938	2
world.	939	2
During	940	2
the	941	2
warm	942	2
summer	943	2
evenings,	944	2
if	945	2
you	946	2
take	947	2
a	948	2
walk	949	2
on	950	2
the	951	2
sea	952	2
beach,	953	2
you	954	2
will	955	2
hear	956	2
the	957	2
gentle	958	2
rippling	959	2
swash	960	2
of	961	2
the	962	2
waves	963	2
and	964	2
some	965	2
say	966	2
that	967	2
it	968	2
must	969	2
be	970	2
the	971	2
gurgling	972	2
voices	973	2
of	974	2
Aqua	975	2
and	976	2
his	977	2
brother	978	2
water	979	2
drops	980	2
telling	981	2
each	982	2
other	983	2
about	984	2
their	985	2
wonderful	986	2
journey	987	2
around	988	2
the	989	2
world.	990	2
It	1	3
was	2	3
cold	3	3
and	4	3
nearly	5	3
dark	6	3
on	7	3
the	8	3
last	9	3
evening	10	3
of	11	3
the	12	3
old	13	3
year,	14	3
and	15	3
the	16	3
snow	17	3
was	18	3
falling	19	3
fast	20	3
and	21	3
furious.	22	3
A	23	3
little	24	3
girl	25	3
no	26	3
one	27	3
sheltered	28	3
from	29	3
the	30	3
gelid	31	3
air	32	3
roamed	33	3
through	34	3
the	35	3
streets	36	3
with	37	3
a	38	3
bare	39	3
head	40	3
and	41	3
naked	42	3
feet,	43	3
looking	44	3
as	45	3
poor	46	3
as	47	3
a	48	3
church	49	3
mouse.	50	3
It's	51	3
true	52	3
she	53	3
had	54	3
on	55	3
a	56	3
pair	57	3
of	58	3
slippers	59	3
her	60	3
mother	61	3
had	62	3
once	63	3
given	64	3
her	65	3
when	66	3
she	67	3
left	68	3
home,	69	3
but	70	3
they	71	3
were	72	3
as	73	3
much	74	3
use	75	3
to	76	3
her	77	3
as	78	3
a	79	3
chocolate	80	3
teapot.	81	3
The	82	3
slippers	83	3
owned	84	3
by	85	3
her	86	3
mother	87	3
were	88	3
so	89	3
large	90	3
that	91	3
the	92	3
emaciated	93	3
little	94	3
creature	95	3
had	96	3
lost	97	3
them	98	3
while	99	3
running	100	3
across	101	3
the	102	3
street	103	3
to	104	3
avoid	105	3
two	106	3
carriages	107	3
that	108	3
were	109	3
rolling	110	3
along	111	3
at	112	3
a	113	3
terrible	114	3
rate.	115	3
One	116	3
of	117	3
the	118	3
slippers	119	3
she	120	3
could	121	3
not	122	3
find,	123	3
and	124	3
a	125	3
boy	126	3
seized	127	3
upon	128	3
the	129	3
other,	130	3
saying	131	3
that	132	3
he	133	3
could	134	3
use	135	3
it	136	3
as	137	3
a	138	3
home	139	3
for	140	3
his	141	3
little	142	3
pet	143	3
mouse.	144	3
So	145	3
with	146	3
her	147	3
naked	148	3
feet,	149	3
which	150	3
were	151	3
quite	152	3
red	153	3
and	154	3
blue	155	3
with	156	3
the	157	3
cold,	158	3
the	159	3
little	160	3
girl	161	3
went	162	3
on,	163	3
wondering	164	3
how	165	3
she	166	3
would	167	3
get	168	3
through	169	3
this	170	3
dreadful	171	3
night.	172	3
She	173	3
approached	174	3
an	175	3
old	176	3
hovel	177	3
she	178	3
had	179	3
used	180	3
as	181	3
a	182	3
shelter	183	3
a	184	3
few	185	3
times	186	3
before,	187	3
and	188	3
found	189	3
the	190	3
entrance	191	3
was	192	3
locked.	193	3
Tough	194	3
luck	195	3
for	196	3
the	197	3
girl!	198	3
This	199	3
day	200	3
was	201	3
even	202	3
worse	203	3
than	204	3
the	205	3
others.	206	3
No	207	3
Good	208	3
Samaritan	209	3
had	210	3
given	211	3
her	212	3
even	213	3
a	214	3
penny.	215	3
And	216	3
she	217	3
had	218	3
no	219	3
luck	220	3
selling	221	3
any	222	3
matches	223	3
that	224	3
she	225	3
carried	226	3
in	227	3
the	228	3
old	229	3
apron	230	3
her	231	3
grandmother	232	3
had	233	3
given	234	3
her.	235	3
Poor	236	3
little	237	3
child,	238	3
she	239	3
looked	240	3
the	241	3
picture	242	3
of	243	3
misery.	244	3
On	245	3
her	246	3
long,	247	3
fair	248	3
hair,	249	3
which	250	3
hung	251	3
in	252	3
curls	253	3
on	254	3
her	255	3
shoulders,	256	3
the	257	3
snowflakes	258	3
kept	259	3
landing,	260	3
but	261	3
she	262	3
did	263	3
not	264	3
notice	265	3
them	266	3
as	267	3
she	268	3
shivered	269	3
along.	270	3
She	271	3
was	272	3
losing	273	3
strength	274	3
and	275	3
beginning	276	3
to	277	3
doubt	278	3
she	279	3
could	280	3
weather	281	3
this	282	3
storm.	283	3
It	284	3
was	285	3
New	286	3
Year's,	287	3
and	288	3
the	289	3
girl	290	3
asked	291	3
herself	292	3
why,	293	3
as	294	3
lights	295	3
shone	296	3
from	297	3
every	298	3
window,	299	3
and	300	3
the	301	3
savory	302	3
smell	303	3
of	304	3
roast	305	3
goose	306	3
crept	307	3
out	308	3
on	309	3
the	310	3
streets,	311	3
she	312	3
was	313	3
outside	314	3
all	315	3
alone.	316	3
Exhausted,	317	3
she	318	3
finally	319	3
sat	320	3
down	321	3
in	322	3
a	323	3
corner	324	3
behind	325	3
the	326	3
little	327	3
bakery.	328	3
She	329	3
put	330	3
a	331	3
rag	332	3
she	333	3
had	334	3
found	335	3
over	336	3
her	337	3
legs	338	3
to	339	3
cover	340	3
herself,	341	3
but	342	3
she	343	3
could	344	3
not	345	3
keep	346	3
off	347	3
the	348	3
cold.	349	3
The	350	3
girl,	351	3
who	352	3
the	353	3
night	354	3
air	355	3
had	356	3
completely	357	3
enveloped,	358	3
dared	359	3
not	360	3
go	361	3
home,	362	3
for	363	3
she	364	3
had	365	3
sold	366	3
no	367	3
matches.	368	3
Her	369	3
father	370	3
had	371	3
been	372	3
mean	373	3
and	374	3
moody	375	3
ever	376	3
since	377	3
his	378	3
wife	379	3
had	380	3
gone	381	3
to	382	3
meet	383	3
her	384	3
Maker.	385	3
He	386	3
would	387	3
certainly	388	3
beat	389	3
her,	390	3
as	391	3
he	392	3
has	393	3
done	394	3
several	395	3
times	396	3
in	397	3
the	398	3
weeks	399	3
past,	400	3
because	401	3
she	402	3
had	403	3
not	404	3
earned	405	3
any	406	3
money	407	3
today.	408	3
Besides,	409	3
it	410	3
was	411	3
almost	412	3
as	413	3
cold	414	3
at	415	3
home	416	3
as	417	3
outside,	418	3
for	419	3
they	420	3
had	421	3
only	422	3
a	423	3
patchy	424	3
roof	425	3
to	426	3
cover	427	3
them.	428	3
The	429	3
girl's	430	3
little	431	3
hands	432	3
were	433	3
almost	434	3
frozen	435	3
solid	436	3
so	437	3
she	438	3
decided	439	3
that	440	3
a	441	3
burning	442	3
match	443	3
might	444	3
be	445	3
of	446	3
some	447	3
good.	448	3
'Scratch!'	449	3
sounded	450	3
the	451	3
match	452	3
as	453	3
she	454	3
drew	455	3
it	456	3
out.	457	3
How	458	3
it	459	3
sputtered	460	3
as	461	3
it	462	3
burnt!	463	3
It	464	3
gave	465	3
a	466	3
warm,	467	3
candle-like	468	3
bright	469	3
light	470	3
that	471	3
the	472	3
girl	473	3
hid	474	3
from	475	3
the	476	3
world	477	3
as	478	3
she	479	3
held	480	3
her	481	3
hand	482	3
over	483	3
it.	484	3
Why	485	3
had	486	3
no	487	3
one	488	3
wanted	489	3
to	490	3
buy	491	3
even	492	3
one	493	3
match?	494	3
A	495	3
wonderful	496	3
light,	497	3
it	498	3
was	499	3
really.	500	3
It	501	3
seemed	502	3
to	503	3
the	504	3
girl	505	3
that	506	3
she	507	3
was	508	3
sitting	509	3
by	510	3
a	511	3
large	512	3
iron	513	3
stove,	514	3
with	515	3
polished	516	3
brass	517	3
feet	518	3
and	519	3
a	520	3
brass	521	3
ornament.	522	3
How	523	3
the	524	3
fire	525	3
burned!	526	3
The	527	3
girl	528	3
was	529	3
pleased	530	3
and	531	3
the	532	3
fire	533	3
actually	534	3
seemed	535	3
so	536	3
warm	537	3
that	538	3
the	539	3
child	540	3
stretched	541	3
out	542	3
her	543	3
feet	544	3
as	545	3
if	546	3
to	547	3
warm	548	3
them,	549	3
when	550	3
suddenly	551	3
the	552	3
flame	553	3
of	554	3
the	555	3
match	556	3
went	557	3
out.	558	3
It	559	3
was	560	3
a	561	3
short,	562	3
stubby	563	3
match	564	3
that	565	3
the	566	3
little	567	3
girl	568	3
next	569	3
rubbed	570	3
on	571	3
the	572	3
wall.	573	3
It	574	3
burst	575	3
into	576	3
a	577	3
flame,	578	3
and	579	3
lo	580	3
and	581	3
behold,	582	3
the	583	3
girl	584	3
was	585	3
transported	586	3
from	587	3
her	588	3
dank	589	3
city	590	3
to	591	3
a	592	3
beautiful,	593	3
sunny	594	3
forest.	595	3
She	596	3
heard	597	3
the	598	3
birds	599	3
chirping	600	3
and	601	3
she	602	3
was	603	3
surrounded	604	3
by	605	3
wildflowers	606	3
and	607	3
birches	608	3
as	609	3
white	610	3
as	611	3
snow.	612	3
A	613	3
little	614	3
squirrel	615	3
hid	616	3
some	617	3
food	618	3
in	619	3
the	620	3
ground	621	3
and	622	3
scurried	623	3
off	624	3
into	625	3
the	626	3
underbrush.	627	3
The	628	3
girl	629	3
was	630	3
curious,	631	3
so	632	3
she	633	3
dug	634	3
some	635	3
squirrel	636	3
food	637	3
up	638	3
to	639	3
see	640	3
what	641	3
it	642	3
was,	643	3
but	644	3
then	645	3
she	646	3
forgot	647	3
to	648	3
put	649	3
it	650	3
back.	651	3
The	652	3
squirrel	653	3
came	654	3
back	655	3
and	656	3
looked	657	3
in	658	3
its	659	3
hiding	660	3
place,	661	3
but	662	3
the	663	3
food	664	3
was	665	3
nowhere	666	3
to	667	3
be	668	3
found.	669	3
Then	670	3
the	671	3
match	672	3
went	673	3
out,	674	3
and	675	3
it	676	3
wasn't	677	3
the	678	3
forest	679	3
that	680	3
remained	681	3
before	682	3
her	683	3
eyes.	684	3
It	685	3
was	686	3
only	687	3
the	688	3
thick,	689	3
damp,	690	3
cold	691	3
wall.	692	3
The	693	3
girl	694	3
looked	695	3
despondently	696	3
into	697	3
the	698	3
sky	699	3
that	700	3
was	701	3
now	702	3
fully	703	3
darkened	704	3
and	705	3
suddenly	706	3
she	707	3
saw	708	3
a	709	3
star	710	3
fall,	711	3
leaving	712	3
behind	713	3
it	714	3
a	715	3
bright	716	3
streak	717	3
of	718	3
fire.	719	3
'Someone	720	3
is	721	3
dying,'	722	3
thought	723	3
the	724	3
little	725	3
girl.	726	3
It	727	3
was	728	3
her	729	3
old	730	3
grandmother,	731	3
the	732	3
one	733	3
who	734	3
had	735	3
loved	736	3
her	737	3
the	738	3
most,	739	3
and	740	3
the	741	3
one	742	3
who	743	3
the	744	3
girl	745	3
used	746	3
to	747	3
visit	748	3
every	749	3
Sunday,	750	3
who	751	3
had	752	3
told	753	3
her	754	3
that	755	3
when	756	3
a	757	3
star	758	3
falls,	759	3
a	760	3
soul	761	3
leaves	762	3
this	763	3
earth.	764	3
It	765	3
was	766	3
her	767	3
last	768	3
match	769	3
that	770	3
the	771	3
little	772	3
girl	773	3
now	774	3
rubbed	775	3
on	776	3
the	777	3
wall	778	3
and	779	3
the	780	3
light	781	3
again	782	3
shone	783	3
round	784	3
her.	785	3
Her	786	3
old	787	3
grandmother	788	3
in	789	3
the	790	3
brightness	791	3
stood,	792	3
loving	793	3
in	794	3
her	795	3
appearance.	796	3
The	797	3
girl	798	3
understood	799	3
her	800	3
grandmother	801	3
would	802	3
soon	803	3
disappear,	804	3
but	805	3
she	806	3
tried	807	3
to	808	3
play	809	3
for	810	3
time.	811	3
'Grandmother,'	812	3
cried	813	3
the	814	3
little	815	3
one,	816	3
'O	817	3
take	818	3
me	819	3
with	820	3
you!	821	3
I	822	3
know	823	3
you	824	3
will	825	3
go	826	3
away	827	3
when	828	3
the	829	3
match	830	3
burns	831	3
out!'	832	3
The	833	3
girl	834	3
decided	835	3
to	836	3
light	837	3
the	838	3
whole	839	3
bundle	840	3
of	841	3
matches,	842	3
in	843	3
order	844	3
to	845	3
keep	846	3
her	847	3
grandmother	848	3
there.	849	3
The	850	3
girl	851	3
saw	852	3
the	853	3
matches	854	3
glowed	855	3
with	856	3
a	857	3
light	858	3
that	859	3
was	860	3
brighter	861	3
than	862	3
the	863	3
day,	864	3
and	865	3
her	866	3
grandmother	867	3
had	868	3
never	869	3
appeared	870	3
so	871	3
large	872	3
or	873	3
so	874	3
beautiful	875	3
as	876	3
she	877	3
did	878	3
in	879	3
the	880	3
light	881	3
of	882	3
the	883	3
little	884	3
matches.	885	3
The	886	3
grandmother	887	3
then	888	3
took	889	3
the	890	3
little	891	3
girl	892	3
in	893	3
her	894	3
arms,	895	3
and	896	3
they	897	3
both	898	3
flew	899	3
upwards	900	3
in	901	3
brightness	902	3
and	903	3
joy	904	3
far	905	3
above	906	3
the	907	3
earth,	908	3
where	909	3
there	910	3
was	911	3
neither	912	3
cold	913	3
nor	914	3
hunger,	915	3
and	916	3
the	917	3
little	918	3
girl	919	3
felt	920	3
safe	921	3
and	922	3
peaceful.	923	3
In	924	3
the	925	3
dawn	926	3
of	927	3
the	928	3
morning	929	3
there	930	3
lay	931	3
the	932	3
poor	933	3
little	934	3
one,	935	3
not	936	3
frowning,	937	3
but	938	3
smiling	939	3
and	940	3
with	941	3
a	942	3
pale	943	3
face	944	3
leaning	945	3
against	946	3
the	947	3
wall,	948	3
frozen	949	3
and	950	3
stone	951	3
dead.	952	3
'She	953	3
tried	954	3
to	955	3
warm	956	3
herself,'	957	3
said	958	3
some.	959	3
Children	960	3
who	961	3
saw	962	3
her	963	3
were	964	3
asking	965	3
their	966	3
parents	967	3
why	968	3
no	969	3
one	970	3
helped	971	3
the	972	3
girl	973	3
who	974	3
they	975	3
knew	976	3
looked	977	3
dirt	978	3
poor	979	3
and	980	3
helpless.	981	3
Passersby	982	3
who	983	3
saw	984	3
her	985	3
sitting	986	3
motionless	987	3
wished	988	3
they	989	3
could	990	3
have	991	3
helped	992	3
the	993	3
girl,	994	3
but	995	3
their	996	3
good	997	3
intentions	998	3
were	999	3
a	1000	3
day	1001	3
late	1002	3
and	1003	3
a	1004	3
dollar	1005	3
short.	1006	3
Other	1007	3
people	1008	3
suspected	1009	3
the	1010	3
girl	1011	3
had	1012	3
fallen	1013	3
asleep	1014	3
and	1015	3
frozen,	1016	3
but	1017	3
no	1018	3
one	1019	3
imagined	1020	3
what	1021	3
beautiful	1022	3
things	1023	3
she	1024	3
had	1025	3
seen,	1026	3
nor	1027	3
into	1028	3
what	1029	3
glory	1030	3
she	1031	3
had	1032	3
entered	1033	3
with	1034	3
her	1035	3
grandmother,	1036	3
on	1037	3
New	1038	3
Year's	1039	3
day.	1040	3
Once	1	4
upon	2	4
a	3	4
time	4	4
the	5	4
birds	6	4
took	7	4
it	8	4
into	9	4
their	10	4
heads	11	4
that	12	4
they	13	4
would	14	4
like	15	4
a	16	4
master,	17	4
and	18	4
that	19	4
one	20	4
of	21	4
their	22	4
number	23	4
must	24	4
be	25	4
chosen	26	4
king.	27	4
A	28	4
meeting	29	4
of	30	4
all	31	4
the	32	4
birds	33	4
was	34	4
called	35	4
and	36	4
though	37	4
they	38	4
understood	39	4
the	40	4
birds	41	4
who	42	4
were	43	4
from	44	4
the	45	4
most	46	4
distant	47	4
lands	48	4
would	49	4
be	50	4
unable	51	4
to	52	4
come,	53	4
many	54	4
birds	55	4
came	56	4
from	57	4
faraway	58	4
meadows	59	4
and	60	4
woods.	61	4
The	62	4
eagle,	63	4
who	64	4
already	65	4
thought	66	4
himself	67	4
the	68	4
de	69	4
facto	70	4
king,	71	4
arrived	72	4
fashionably	73	4
late.	74	4
It	75	4
was	76	4
a	77	4
hawk	78	4
who	79	4
was	80	4
most	81	4
excited	82	4
about	83	4
the	84	4
meeting,	85	4
because	86	4
he	87	4
was	88	4
the	89	4
dark	90	4
horse	91	4
for	92	4
king.	93	4
The	94	4
small	95	4
fry	96	4
came	97	4
too,	98	4
and	99	4
the	100	4
robin,	101	4
the	102	4
bluebird,	103	4
the	104	4
owl,	105	4
the	106	4
lark,	107	4
and	108	4
the	109	4
sparrow,	110	4
who	111	4
had	112	4
only	113	4
a	114	4
chance	115	4
in	116	4
a	117	4
million	118	4
to	119	4
be	120	4
king,	121	4
were	122	4
all	123	4
present	124	4
at	125	4
the	126	4
meeting.	127	4
The	128	4
cuckoo,	129	4
who	130	4
was	131	4
almost	132	4
not	133	4
invited	134	4
because	135	4
his	136	4
call	137	4
so	138	4
annoyed	139	4
the	140	4
other	141	4
birds,	142	4
came	143	4
too.	144	4
It	145	4
was	146	4
the	147	4
very	148	4
little	149	4
bird	150	4
who	151	4
had	152	4
no	153	4
name	154	4
at	155	4
all,	156	4
however,	157	4
that	158	4
would	159	4
end	160	4
up	161	4
overturning	162	4
the	163	4
balance	164	4
of	165	4
power	166	4
among	167	4
the	168	4
birds.	169	4
That	170	4
there	171	4
would	172	4
be	173	4
great	174	4
confusion	175	4
and	176	4
noise	177	4
among	178	4
the	179	4
birds	180	4
at	181	4
the	182	4
meeting	183	4
was	184	4
to	185	4
be	186	4
expected,	187	4
given	188	4
the	189	4
sheer	190	4
numbers	191	4
of	192	4
birds	193	4
that	194	4
have	195	4
gathered.	196	4
There	197	4
was	198	4
piping,	199	4
hissing,	200	4
and	201	4
clacking,	202	4
but	203	4
finally	204	4
it	205	4
was	206	4
decided	207	4
that	208	4
the	209	4
bird	210	4
that	211	4
could	212	4
fly	213	4
the	214	4
highest	215	4
should	216	4
be	217	4
king.	218	4
The	219	4
little	220	4
bird	221	4
lay	222	4
low	223	4
near	224	4
the	225	4
eagle	226	4
at	227	4
first,	228	4
but	229	4
the	230	4
eagle	231	4
did	232	4
not	233	4
notice	234	4
the	235	4
bird	236	4
hopping	237	4
onto	238	4
his	239	4
back	240	4
right	241	4
as	242	4
the	243	4
competition	244	4
was	245	4
about	246	4
to	247	4
commence.	248	4
Into	249	4
the	250	4
air	251	4
in	252	4
a	253	4
great	254	4
flock	255	4
all	256	4
the	257	4
birds	258	4
flew	259	4
when	260	4
the	261	4
signal	262	4
was	263	4
given.	264	4
The	265	4
air	266	4
was	267	4
full	268	4
of	269	4
dust,	270	4
and	271	4
it	272	4
seemed	273	4
as	274	4
if	275	4
a	276	4
black	277	4
cloud	278	4
were	279	4
floating	280	4
over	281	4
the	282	4
field.	283	4
You	284	4
could	285	4
hear	286	4
the	287	4
birds	288	4
chirping	289	4
and	290	4
flapping	291	4
from	292	4
fields	293	4
that	294	4
were	295	4
miles	296	4
away.	297	4
The	298	4
little	299	4
birds	300	4
that	301	4
soon	302	4
grew	303	4
tired	304	4
fell	305	4
back	306	4
quickly	307	4
to	308	4
earth.	309	4
The	310	4
fact	311	4
that	312	4
the	313	4
larger	314	4
ones	315	4
held	316	4
out	317	4
longer,	318	4
and	319	4
flew	320	4
higher	321	4
and	322	4
higher,	323	4
but	324	4
the	325	4
eagle	326	4
flew	327	4
highest	328	4
of	329	4
any,	330	4
surprised	331	4
no	332	4
one.	333	4
Could	334	4
anyone	335	4
stop	336	4
the	337	4
eagle	338	4
that	339	4
seemed	340	4
to	341	4
be	342	4
flying	343	4
straight	344	4
into	345	4
the	346	4
sun?	347	4
The	348	4
other	349	4
birds	350	4
gave	351	4
out	352	4
one	353	4
by	354	4
one	355	4
and	356	4
when	357	4
the	358	4
eagle	359	4
saw	360	4
this	361	4
he	362	4
thought,	363	4
'What	364	4
is	365	4
the	366	4
use	367	4
of	368	4
flying	369	4
any	370	4
higher?	371	4
This	372	4
victory	373	4
is	374	4
in	375	4
the	376	4
bag	377	4
and	378	4
I	379	4
am	380	4
king!'	381	4
Then	382	4
the	383	4
birds	384	4
below	385	4
called	386	4
with	387	4
one	388	4
accord,	389	4
'Come	390	4
back,	391	4
come	392	4
back!	393	4
It	394	4
is	395	4
you	396	4
who	397	4
must	398	4
be	399	4
our	400	4
king	401	4
because	402	4
no	403	4
one	404	4
can	405	4
fly	406	4
as	407	4
high	408	4
as	409	4
you.'	410	4
'Except	411	4
me!'	412	4
cried	413	4
a	414	4
shrill,	415	4
shrill	416	4
voice,	417	4
and	418	4
out	419	4
of	420	4
the	421	4
blue	422	4
the	423	4
little	424	4
bird	425	4
without	426	4
a	427	4
name	428	4
rose	429	4
from	430	4
the	431	4
eagle's	432	4
back,	433	4
where	434	4
he	435	4
had	436	4
lain	437	4
hidden	438	4
in	439	4
the	440	4
feathers.	441	4
His	442	4
guile	443	4
was	444	4
the	445	4
ace	446	4
up	447	4
his	448	4
sleeve,	449	4
and	450	4
he	451	4
laughed	452	4
to	453	4
himself	454	4
at	455	4
how	456	4
easy	457	4
it	458	4
had	459	4
been	460	4
to	461	4
outwit	462	4
the	463	4
other	464	4
birds.	465	4
Higher	466	4
and	467	4
higher	468	4
he	469	4
mounted,	470	4
until	471	4
he	472	4
was	473	4
lost	474	4
to	475	4
sight,	476	4
and	477	4
then	478	4
folding	479	4
his	480	4
wings	481	4
together,	482	4
he	483	4
sank	484	4
to	485	4
earth	486	4
crying	487	4
shrilly,	488	4
'I	489	4
am	490	4
king,	491	4
I	492	4
am	493	4
king!'	494	4
The	495	4
eagle	496	4
tricked	497	4
by	498	4
the	499	4
little	500	4
bird	501	4
had	502	4
not	503	4
sensed	504	4
the	505	4
bird	506	4
in	507	4
his	508	4
feathers	509	4
and	510	4
so	511	4
had	512	4
not	513	4
at	514	4
all	515	4
expected	516	4
the	517	4
bird	518	4
to	519	4
come	520	4
flying	521	4
out	522	4
like	523	4
that.	524	4
The	525	4
birds	526	4
back	527	4
on	528	4
earth	529	4
were	530	4
all	531	4
up	532	4
in	533	4
arms.	534	4
'You,	535	4
and	536	4
not	537	4
the	538	4
eagle,	539	4
our	540	4
king?'	541	4
the	542	4
birds	543	4
cried,	544	4
fuming	545	4
with	546	4
anger.	547	4
'You	548	4
have	549	4
done	550	4
this	551	4
by	552	4
breaking	553	4
every	554	4
rule	555	4
in	556	4
the	557	4
book,	558	4
so	559	4
we	560	4
will	561	4
not	562	4
have	563	4
you,	564	4
who	565	4
are	566	4
simply	567	4
tricky	568	4
and	569	4
cunning,	570	4
to	571	4
reign	572	4
over	573	4
us.'	574	4
The	575	4
bird	576	4
without	577	4
a	578	4
name	579	4
then	580	4
decided	581	4
to	582	4
clear	583	4
the	584	4
air	585	4
and	586	4
said,	587	4
'Then	588	4
let	589	4
everyone	590	4
start	591	4
with	592	4
a	593	4
clean	594	4
slate	595	4
and	596	4
perform	597	4
a	598	4
new	599	4
challenging	600	4
task.	601	4
Then	602	4
we	603	4
can	604	4
decide	605	4
who	606	4
should	607	4
be	608	4
the	609	4
real	610	4
king.'	611	4
Then	612	4
the	613	4
birds	614	4
gathered	615	4
together	616	4
again	617	4
and	618	4
decided	619	4
the	620	4
case	621	4
would	622	4
be	623	4
resolved	624	4
by	625	4
making	626	4
a	627	4
new	628	4
condition,	629	4
which	630	4
was	631	4
that	632	4
he	633	4
should	634	4
be	635	4
king	636	4
who	637	4
could	638	4
go	639	4
the	640	4
deepest	641	4
into	642	4
the	643	4
earth.	644	4
So	645	4
the	646	4
little	647	4
bird	648	4
who	649	4
the	650	4
other	651	4
birds	652	4
despised	653	4
was	654	4
now	655	4
back	656	4
to	657	4
square	658	4
one.	659	4
Confident,	660	4
he	661	4
remained,	662	4
however,	663	4
that	664	4
if	665	4
he	666	4
played	667	4
his	668	4
cards	669	4
right,	670	4
he	671	4
could	672	4
be	673	4
king.	674	4
How	675	4
the	676	4
goose	677	4
wallowed	678	4
in	679	4
the	680	4
sand,	681	4
and	682	4
the	683	4
duck	684	4
strove	685	4
to	686	4
dig	687	4
a	688	4
hole	689	4
for	690	4
the	691	4
new	692	4
task!	693	4
All	694	4
the	695	4
other	696	4
birds	697	4
tried	698	4
to	699	4
hide	700	4
themselves	701	4
in	702	4
the	703	4
ground,	704	4
too,	705	4
until	706	4
they	707	4
were	708	4
practically	709	4
blue	710	4
in	711	4
the	712	4
face.	713	4
The	714	4
nameless	715	4
little	716	4
bird	717	4
that	718	4
was	719	4
as	720	4
bold	721	4
as	722	4
brass	723	4
found	724	4
a	725	4
pitch	726	4
dark	727	4
mouse's	728	4
hole,	729	4
and	730	4
creeping	731	4
in	732	4
cried,	733	4
'I	734	4
am	735	4
king,	736	4
I	737	4
am	738	4
king!'	739	4
but	740	4
it	741	4
was	742	4
of	743	4
no	744	4
avail.	745	4
'You,	746	4
our	747	4
king?'	748	4
all	749	4
the	750	4
remaining	751	4
birds	752	4
who	753	4
the	754	4
littlest	755	4
bird	756	4
had	757	4
outwitted	758	4
cried	759	4
again,	760	4
even	761	4
more	762	4
angrily	763	4
than	764	4
before.	765	4
'Do	766	4
you	767	4
think	768	4
we	769	4
would	770	4
reward	771	4
your	772	4
cunning	773	4
in	774	4
this	775	4
way?	776	4
No,	777	4
no!	778	4
You	779	4
shall	780	4
stay	781	4
in	782	4
the	783	4
earth	784	4
till	785	4
you	786	4
die	787	4
of	788	4
hunger!'	789	4
So	790	4
they	791	4
shut	792	4
up	793	4
the	794	4
little	795	4
bird	796	4
in	797	4
the	798	4
mouse's	799	4
hole	800	4
that	801	4
the	802	4
mouse	803	4
gave	804	4
up	805	4
most	806	4
unwillingly,	807	4
and	808	4
bade	809	4
the	810	4
owl	811	4
watch	812	4
him	813	4
carefully	814	4
night	815	4
and	816	4
day.	817	4
Then	818	4
all	819	4
the	820	4
birds	821	4
went	822	4
home	823	4
to	824	4
bed,	825	4
for	826	4
they	827	4
were	828	4
very	829	4
tired,	830	4
but	831	4
the	832	4
owl	833	4
assigned	834	4
by	835	4
the	836	4
birds	837	4
to	838	4
stand	839	4
guard	840	4
found	841	4
his	842	4
job	843	4
was	844	4
lonely	845	4
and	846	4
wearisome	847	4
because	848	4
he	849	4
was	850	4
just	851	4
sitting	852	4
alone	853	4
staring	854	4
at	855	4
the	856	4
mouse's	857	4
hole.	858	4
'I	859	4
can	860	4
close	861	4
one	862	4
eye	863	4
and	864	4
watch	865	4
with	866	4
the	867	4
other,'	868	4
he	869	4
thought.	870	4
So	871	4
he	872	4
closed	873	4
one	874	4
eye	875	4
and	876	4
stared	877	4
steadfastly	878	4
with	879	4
the	880	4
other,	881	4
but	882	4
before	883	4
he	884	4
knew	885	4
it	886	4
he	887	4
forgot	888	4
to	889	4
keep	890	4
that	891	4
one	892	4
open,	893	4
and	894	4
both	895	4
eyes	896	4
were	897	4
fast	898	4
asleep.	899	4
Then	900	4
the	901	4
little	902	4
bird	903	4
guarded	904	4
by	905	4
the	906	4
owl	907	4
peeped	908	4
out,	909	4
and	910	4
when	911	4
he	912	4
saw	913	4
the	914	4
owl's	915	4
two	916	4
eyes	917	4
tight	918	4
shut,	919	4
he	920	4
slipped	921	4
from	922	4
the	923	4
hole	924	4
and	925	4
flew	926	4
away.	927	4
He	928	4
wanted	929	4
to	930	4
shout,	931	4
'I	932	4
am	933	4
king'	934	4
so	935	4
that	936	4
the	937	4
owl	938	4
could	939	4
hear	940	4
him	941	4
as	942	4
he	943	4
flew,	944	4
but	945	4
thought	946	4
better	947	4
of	948	4
it.	949	4
From	950	4
this	951	4
time	952	4
on,	953	4
the	954	4
owl	955	4
fooled	956	4
by	957	4
the	958	4
little	959	4
bird	960	4
has	961	4
not	962	4
dared	963	4
to	964	4
show	965	4
himself	966	4
by	967	4
day	968	4
for	969	4
fear	970	4
the	971	4
birds	972	4
should	973	4
beat	974	4
the	975	4
living	976	4
daylights	977	4
out	978	4
of	979	4
him.	980	4
He	981	4
flies	982	4
about	983	4
only	984	4
at	985	4
nighttime,	986	4
hating	987	4
and	988	4
pursuing	989	4
not	990	4
the	991	4
bird,	992	4
but	993	4
the	994	4
mouse	995	4
for	996	4
having	997	4
made	998	4
the	999	4
hole	1000	4
into	1001	4
which	1002	4
the	1003	4
little	1004	4
bird	1005	4
crept.	1006	4
And	1007	4
the	1008	4
little	1009	4
bird	1010	4
also	1011	4
keeps	1012	4
out	1013	4
of	1014	4
sight,	1015	4
for	1016	4
he	1017	4
fears	1018	4
that	1019	4
the	1020	4
other	1021	4
birds	1022	4
should	1023	4
punish	1024	4
him	1025	4
for	1026	4
his	1027	4
cunning.	1028	4
The	1029	4
rejection	1030	4
by	1031	4
the	1032	4
other	1033	4
birds	1034	4
was	1035	4
a	1036	4
bitter	1037	4
pill	1038	4
to	1039	4
swallow	1040	4
for	1041	4
the	1042	4
nameless	1043	4
bird	1044	4
the	1045	4
owl	1046	4
had	1047	4
let	1048	4
slip	1049	4
away.	1050	4
He	1051	4
hides	1052	4
in	1053	4
the	1054	4
hedges,	1055	4
and	1056	4
when	1057	4
he	1058	4
thinks	1059	4
himself	1060	4
quite	1061	4
safe,	1062	4
he	1063	4
sings	1064	4
out,	1065	4
'I	1066	4
am	1067	4
king,	1068	4
I	1069	4
am	1070	4
king!'	1071	4
And	1072	4
the	1073	4
other	1074	4
birds	1075	4
in	1076	4
mockery	1077	4
call	1078	4
out,	1079	4
'Yes,	1080	4
yes,	1081	4
the	1082	4
hedge-king,	1083	4
the	1084	4
hedge-king!'	1085	4
At	1	5
ten	2	5
years	3	5
old,	4	5
I	5	5
could	6	5
not	7	5
figure	8	5
out	9	5
what	10	5
it	11	5
was	12	5
that	13	5
this	14	5
Elvis	15	5
Presley	16	5
guy	17	5
had	18	5
that	19	5
the	20	5
rest	21	5
of	22	5
us	23	5
boys	24	5
did	25	5
not	26	5
have.	27	5
He	28	5
seemed	29	5
to	30	5
be	31	5
no	32	5
different	33	5
from	34	5
the	35	5
rest	36	5
of	37	5
us.	38	5
He	39	5
was	40	5
simply	41	5
a	42	5
man	43	5
who	44	5
had	45	5
a	46	5
head,	47	5
two	48	5
arms	49	5
and	50	5
two	51	5
legs.	52	5
It	53	5
must	54	5
have	55	5
been	56	5
something	57	5
pretty	58	5
superlative	59	5
that	60	5
he	61	5
had	62	5
hidden	63	5
away,	64	5
because	65	5
he	66	5
had	67	5
every	68	5
young	69	5
girl	70	5
at	71	5
the	72	5
orphanage	73	5
wrapped	74	5
around	75	5
his	76	5
little	77	5
finger.	78	5
At	79	5
about	80	5
nine	81	5
o'clock	82	5
on	83	5
Saturday	84	5
morning,	85	5
I	86	5
figured	87	5
a	88	5
good	89	5
solution	90	5
was	91	5
to	92	5
ask	93	5
Eugene	94	5
Correthers,	95	5
who	96	5
was	97	5
one	98	5
of	99	5
the	100	5
older	101	5
and	102	5
smarter	103	5
boys,	104	5
what	105	5
it	106	5
was	107	5
that	108	5
made	109	5
this	110	5
Elvis	111	5
guy	112	5
so	113	5
special.	114	5
He	115	5
told	116	5
me	117	5
that	118	5
it	119	5
was	120	5
not	121	5
anything	122	5
about	123	5
Elvis's	124	5
personality,	125	5
but	126	5
his	127	5
wavy	128	5
hair,	129	5
and	130	5
the	131	5
way	132	5
he	133	5
moved	134	5
his	135	5
body.	136	5
About	137	5
a	138	5
half	139	5
an	140	5
hour	141	5
later,	142	5
the	143	5
boys	144	5
in	145	5
the	146	5
orphanage	147	5
called	148	5
down	149	5
to	150	5
the	151	5
main	152	5
dining	153	5
room	154	5
by	155	5
the	156	5
matron	157	5
were	158	5
told	159	5
that	160	5
they	161	5
were	162	5
all	163	5
going	164	5
to	165	5
downtown	166	5
Jacksonville,	167	5
Florida	168	5
to	169	5
get	170	5
a	171	5
new	172	5
pair	173	5
of	174	5
Buster	175	5
Brown	176	5
shoes	177	5
and	178	5
a	179	5
haircut.	180	5
That	181	5
is	182	5
when	183	5
I	184	5
got	185	5
this	186	5
big	187	5
idea,	188	5
which	189	5
hit	190	5
me	191	5
like	192	5
a	193	5
ton	194	5
of	195	5
bricks.	196	5
If	197	5
the	198	5
Elvis	199	5
haircut	200	5
was	201	5
the	202	5
big	203	5
secret,	204	5
then	205	5
Elvis's	206	5
haircut	207	5
I	208	5
was	209	5
going	210	5
to	211	5
get.	212	5
I	213	5
was	214	5
going	215	5
to	216	5
have	217	5
my	218	5
day	219	5
in	220	5
the	221	5
sun,	222	5
and	223	5
all	224	5
the	225	5
way	226	5
to	227	5
town	228	5
that	229	5
was	230	5
all	231	5
I	232	5
talked	233	5
about.	234	5
The	235	5
fact	236	5
that	237	5
I	238	5
was	239	5
getting	240	5
an	241	5
Elvis	242	5
haircut,	243	5
not	244	5
just	245	5
the	246	5
simple	247	5
fact	248	5
that	249	5
we	250	5
were	251	5
getting	252	5
out	253	5
of	254	5
the	255	5
orphanage,	256	5
made	257	5
me	258	5
particularly	259	5
loquacious.	260	5
I	261	5
told	262	5
everybody,	263	5
including	264	5
the	265	5
orphanage	266	5
matron	267	5
I	268	5
normally	269	5
feared,	270	5
that	271	5
I	272	5
was	273	5
going	274	5
to	275	5
look	276	5
just	277	5
like	278	5
Elvis	279	5
Presley	280	5
and	281	5
that	282	5
I	283	5
would	284	5
learn	285	5
to	286	5
move	287	5
around	288	5
just	289	5
like	290	5
he	291	5
did	292	5
and	293	5
that	294	5
I	295	5
would	296	5
be	297	5
rich	298	5
and	299	5
famous	300	5
one	301	5
day,	302	5
just	303	5
like	304	5
him.	305	5
The	306	5
matron	307	5
understood	308	5
my	309	5
idea	310	5
was	311	5
something	312	5
that	313	5
I	314	5
was	315	5
really	316	5
excited	317	5
about	318	5
and	319	5
said	320	5
nothing.	321	5
When	322	5
I	323	5
got	324	5
my	325	5
new	326	5
Buster	327	5
Brown	328	5
shoes,	329	5
I	330	5
was	331	5
smiling	332	5
from	333	5
ear	334	5
to	335	5
ear.	336	5
Those	337	5
shoes,	338	5
they	339	5
shined	340	5
really	341	5
brightly,	342	5
and	343	5
I	344	5
liked	345	5
looking	346	5
at	347	5
the	348	5
bones	349	5
in	350	5
my	351	5
feet,	352	5
which	353	5
I	354	5
had	355	5
never	356	5
seen	357	5
before,	358	5
through	359	5
a	360	5
special	361	5
x-ray	362	5
machine	363	5
they	364	5
had	365	5
in	366	5
the	367	5
shoe	368	5
store	369	5
that	370	5
made	371	5
the	372	5
bones	373	5
in	374	5
your	375	5
feet	376	5
look	377	5
green.	378	5
I	379	5
was	380	5
now	381	5
almost	382	5
ready	383	5
to	384	5
go	385	5
back	386	5
to	387	5
the	388	5
orphanage	389	5
and	390	5
practice	391	5
being	392	5
like	393	5
the	394	5
man	395	5
who	396	5
all	397	5
the	398	5
girls	399	5
loved,	400	5
since	401	5
I	402	5
had	403	5
my	404	5
new	405	5
Buster	406	5
Brown	407	5
shoes.	408	5
It	409	5
was	410	5
the	411	5
new	412	5
haircut,	413	5
though,	414	5
that	415	5
I	416	5
needed	417	5
to	418	5
complete	419	5
my	420	5
new	421	5
look.	422	5
We	423	5
finally	424	5
arrived	425	5
at	426	5
the	427	5
unassuming,	428	5
unembellished	429	5
barbershop,	430	5
where	431	5
they	432	5
cut	433	5
our	434	5
hair	435	5
for	436	5
free	437	5
because	438	5
we	439	5
were	440	5
orphans.	441	5
Even	442	5
though	443	5
we	444	5
were	445	5
supposed	446	5
to	447	5
slowly	448	5
wait	449	5
to	450	5
be	451	5
called,	452	5
I	453	5
ran	454	5
straight	455	5
up	456	5
to	457	5
one	458	5
of	459	5
the	460	5
barber	461	5
chairs	462	5
and	463	5
climbed	464	5
up	465	5
onto	466	5
the	467	5
board	468	5
the	469	5
barber	470	5
placed	471	5
across	472	5
the	473	5
arms	474	5
to	475	5
make	476	5
me	477	5
sit	478	5
up	479	5
higher.	480	5
I	481	5
looked	482	5
at	483	5
the	484	5
man	485	5
and	486	5
said,	487	5
with	488	5
a	489	5
beaming	490	5
smile	491	5
on	492	5
my	493	5
face,	494	5
'I	495	5
want	496	5
an	497	5
Elvis	498	5
haircut.	499	5
Can	500	5
you	501	5
make	502	5
my	503	5
hair	504	5
like	505	5
Elvis's?'	506	5
I	507	5
asked.	508	5
The	509	5
barber,	510	5
who	511	5
was	512	5
a	513	5
genial	514	5
young	515	5
man,	516	5
grinned	517	5
back	518	5
at	519	5
me	520	5
and	521	5
said	522	5
that	523	5
he	524	5
would	525	5
try	526	5
his	527	5
best.	528	5
I	529	5
was	530	5
so	531	5
happy	532	5
when	533	5
he	534	5
started	535	5
to	536	5
cut	537	5
my	538	5
hair,	539	5
but	540	5
just	541	5
as	542	5
he	543	5
started	544	5
to	545	5
cut,	546	5
the	547	5
matron,	548	5
who	549	5
had	550	5
been	551	5
watching	552	5
me	553	5
and	554	5
had	555	5
a	556	5
look	557	5
as	558	5
cold	559	5
as	560	5
ice,	561	5
motioned	562	5
for	563	5
him	564	5
to	565	5
come	566	5
over	567	5
to	568	5
where	569	5
she	570	5
was	571	5
standing.	572	5
She	573	5
whispered	574	5
something	575	5
into	576	5
his	577	5
ear	578	5
that	579	5
caused	580	5
the	581	5
barber	582	5
to	583	5
shake	584	5
his	585	5
head,	586	5
like	587	5
he	588	5
was	589	5
telling	590	5
her,	591	5
'No'.	592	5
In	593	5
response,	594	5
the	595	5
matron	596	5
walked	597	5
over	598	5
to	599	5
a	600	5
little	601	5
man	602	5
sitting	603	5
in	604	5
an	605	5
office	606	5
chair	607	5
that	608	5
squeaked	609	5
as	610	5
it	611	5
rolled	612	5
around	613	5
the	614	5
floor	615	5
and	616	5
spoke	617	5
to	618	5
him.	619	5
It	620	5
was	621	5
the	622	5
little	623	5
man	624	5
who	625	5
then	626	5
walked	627	5
over	628	5
and	629	5
said	630	5
something	631	5
to	632	5
the	633	5
man	634	5
who	635	5
was	636	5
cutting	637	5
my	638	5
hair.	639	5
The	640	5
next	641	5
thing	642	5
I	643	5
knew,	644	5
the	645	5
man	646	5
who	647	5
was	648	5
cutting	649	5
my	650	5
hair	651	5
told	652	5
me	653	5
that	654	5
he	655	5
was	656	5
no	657	5
longer	658	5
allowed	659	5
to	660	5
give	661	5
me	662	5
an	663	5
Elvis	664	5
cut.	665	5
'Why	666	5
not?'	667	5
I	668	5
cried	669	5
desperately.	670	5
The	671	5
kindly	672	5
barber	673	5
stopped	674	5
by	675	5
the	676	5
matron	677	5
did	678	5
not	679	5
answer,	680	5
but	681	5
from	682	5
his	683	5
expression,	684	5
I	685	5
could	686	5
tell	687	5
that	688	5
he	689	5
wished	690	5
he	691	5
could	692	5
cut	693	5
it	694	5
as	695	5
I	696	5
had	697	5
asked.	698	5
Within	699	5
a	700	5
few	701	5
minutes,	702	5
it	703	5
wasn't	704	5
an	705	5
Elvis	706	5
haircut,	707	5
but	708	5
a	709	5
short	710	5
buzz	711	5
cut	712	5
that	713	5
the	714	5
barber	715	5
had	716	5
given	717	5
me.	718	5
When	719	5
he	720	5
finished	721	5
shaving	722	5
off	723	5
all	724	5
my	725	5
hair	726	5
and	727	5
made	728	5
me	729	5
smell	730	5
real	731	5
good	732	5
with	733	5
his	734	5
powder,	735	5
the	736	5
barber	737	5
handed	738	5
me	739	5
a	740	5
nickel	741	5
and	742	5
told	743	5
me	744	5
to	745	5
go	746	5
outside	747	5
to	748	5
the	749	5
snack	750	5
machine	751	5
and	752	5
buy	753	5
myself	754	5
a	755	5
candy	756	5
bar.	757	5
I	758	5
handed	759	5
him	760	5
the	761	5
nickel	762	5
back	763	5
and	764	5
told	765	5
him	766	5
that	767	5
I	768	5
was	769	5
not	770	5
hungry.	771	5
'I'm	772	5
so	773	5
sorry,	774	5
baby,'	775	5
he	776	5
said,	777	5
as	778	5
I	779	5
climbed	780	5
out	781	5
of	782	5
his	783	5
barber	784	5
chair.	785	5
'I	786	5
am	787	5
not	788	5
a	789	5
baby,'	790	5
I	791	5
said,	792	5
as	793	5
I	794	5
wiped	795	5
the	796	5
tears	797	5
from	798	5
my	799	5
eyes.	800	5
I	801	5
then	802	5
sat	803	5
down	804	5
on	805	5
the	806	5
floor	807	5
and	808	5
brushed	809	5
away	810	5
the	811	5
hair	812	5
that	813	5
had	814	5
accumulated	815	5
on	816	5
my	817	5
shiny	818	5
new	819	5
Buster	820	5
Brown	821	5
shoes.	822	5
My	823	5
head	824	5
was	825	5
no	826	5
longer	827	5
in	828	5
the	829	5
clouds,	830	5
and	831	5
I	832	5
got	833	5
up	834	5
off	835	5
the	836	5
floor,	837	5
brushed	838	5
off	839	5
my	840	5
short	841	5
pants,	842	5
and	843	5
walked	844	5
sullenly	845	5
towards	846	5
the	847	5
door.	848	5
The	849	5
matron	850	5
was	851	5
smiling	852	5
at	853	5
me	854	5
sort	855	5
of	856	5
funny	857	5
like.	858	5
The	859	5
barber	860	5
upset	861	5
by	862	5
the	863	5
matron	864	5
said	865	5
to	866	5
her,	867	5
'You	868	5
are	869	5
just	870	5
a	871	5
damn	872	5
bitch,	873	5
lady.'	874	5
She	875	5
yelled	876	5
back	877	5
at	878	5
him	879	5
at	880	5
the	881	5
top	882	5
of	883	5
her	884	5
lungs,	885	5
before	886	5
walking	887	5
toward	888	5
the	889	5
office,	890	5
as	891	5
fast	892	5
as	893	5
she	894	5
could.	895	5
To	896	5
show	897	5
his	898	5
anger,	899	5
the	900	5
man	901	5
hit	902	5
the	903	5
wall	904	5
with	905	5
his	906	5
hand	907	5
and	908	5
then	909	5
walked	910	5
outside	911	5
where	912	5
he	913	5
stood	914	5
against	915	5
the	916	5
brick	917	5
wall,	918	5
smoking	919	5
a	920	5
cigarette.	921	5
I	922	5
understood	923	5
right	924	5
there	925	5
my	926	5
haircut	927	5
was	928	5
something	929	5
that	930	5
had	931	5
been	932	5
out	933	5
of	934	5
the	935	5
power	936	5
of	937	5
the	938	5
barber	939	5
and	940	5
then	941	5
I	942	5
slowly	943	5
walked	944	5
outside	945	5
to	946	5
join	947	5
the	948	5
man.	949	5
He	950	5
looked	951	5
down,	952	5
smiled	953	5
at	954	5
me,	955	5
then	956	5
he	957	5
patted	958	5
me	959	5
on	960	5
the	961	5
top	962	5
of	963	5
my	964	5
bald	965	5
as	966	5
a	967	5
coot	968	5
head.	969	5
It	970	5
was	971	5
a	972	5
fact	973	5
of	974	5
my	975	5
life	976	5
that	977	5
I	978	5
was	979	5
not	980	5
gonna	981	5
have	982	5
hair	983	5
that	984	5
was	985	5
anything	986	5
like	987	5
Elvis's	988	5
anytime	989	5
soon.	990	5
I	991	5
then	992	5
looked	993	5
up	994	5
at	995	5
the	996	5
barber	997	5
with	998	5
my	999	5
wet	1000	5
red	1001	5
eyes	1002	5
and	1003	5
asked,	1004	5
'Do	1005	5
you	1006	5
know	1007	5
if	1008	5
Elvis	1009	5
Presley	1010	5
has	1011	5
green	1012	5
bones?'	1013	5
This	1	6
is	2	6
a	3	6
story	4	6
of	5	6
how	6	6
Mr.	7	6
Sticky	8	6
got	9	6
in	10	6
Abby's	11	6
fish	12	6
tank.	13	6
'He's	14	6
very	15	6
small,'	16	6
Abby's	17	6
mom	18	6
said	19	6
as	20	6
she	21	6
peered	22	6
at	23	6
the	24	6
tiny	25	6
water	26	6
snail.	27	6
Abby	28	6
said	29	6
that	30	6
he	31	6
would	32	6
grow	33	6
and	34	6
then	35	6
pulled	36	6
her	37	6
pajama	38	6
bottoms	39	6
up	40	6
again	41	6
before	42	6
she	43	6
got	44	6
into	45	6
bed,	46	6
for	47	6
they	48	6
were	49	6
always	50	6
falling	51	6
down.	52	6
Usually,	53	6
Abby's	54	6
mom	55	6
got	56	6
up	57	6
at	58	6
the	59	6
crack	60	6
of	61	6
dawn,	62	6
but	63	6
it	64	6
was	65	6
Abby	66	6
who	67	6
jumped	68	6
out	69	6
of	70	6
bed	71	6
first	72	6
the	73	6
next	74	6
morning	75	6
and	76	6
switched	77	6
on	78	6
the	79	6
light	80	6
in	81	6
her	82	6
fish	83	6
tank,	84	6
which	85	6
contained	86	6
three	87	6
fish.	88	6
At	89	6
first,	90	6
she	91	6
could	92	6
see	93	6
neither	94	6
hide	95	6
nor	96	6
hair	97	6
of	98	6
the	99	6
snail,	100	6
but	101	6
then	102	6
she	103	6
spotted	104	6
him.	105	6
It	106	6
had	107	6
taken	108	6
Abby	109	6
a	110	6
while	111	6
to	112	6
find	113	6
Sticky	114	6
because	115	6
he	116	6
was	117	6
clinging	118	6
to	119	6
the	120	6
glass	121	6
near	122	6
the	123	6
bottom,	124	6
right	125	6
next	126	6
to	127	6
the	128	6
gravel.	129	6
At	130	6
school	131	6
that	132	6
day,	133	6
Abby,	134	6
encouraged	135	6
by	136	6
her	137	6
teacher,	138	6
wrote	139	6
excitedly	140	6
about	141	6
the	142	6
small	143	6
and	144	6
mysterious	145	6
Mr.	146	6
Sticky,	147	6
who	148	6
you	149	6
could	150	6
mistake	151	6
for	152	6
a	153	6
piece	154	6
of	155	6
gravel.	156	6
He	157	6
seemed	158	6
an	159	6
ideal	160	6
pet	161	6
for	162	6
her,	163	6
some	164	6
of	165	6
the	166	6
girls	167	6
in	168	6
her	169	6
class	170	6
teased,	171	6
because	172	6
Abby	173	6
was	174	6
also	175	6
very	176	6
small.	177	6
That	178	6
evening,	179	6
Abby	180	6
turned	181	6
on	182	6
the	183	6
light	184	6
and	185	6
found	186	6
Mr.	187	6
Sticky	188	6
clinging	189	6
to	190	6
the	191	6
pond	192	6
weed	193	6
and	194	6
bobbing	195	6
about	196	6
in	197	6
the	198	6
air	199	6
bubbles.	200	6
'That	201	6
looks	202	6
fun!'	203	6
Abby	204	6
exclaimed.	205	6
She	206	6
tried	207	6
to	208	6
imagine	209	6
what	210	6
it	211	6
must	212	6
be	213	6
like	214	6
to	215	6
have	216	6
to	217	6
hang	218	6
on	219	6
to	220	6
things	221	6
all	222	6
day	223	6
and	224	6
decided	225	6
the	226	6
answer	227	6
was	228	6
that	229	6
it	230	6
was	231	6
probably	232	6
very	233	6
tiring.	234	6
Abby	235	6
told	236	6
her	237	6
mom	238	6
that	239	6
she	240	6
thought	241	6
Sticky	242	6
had	243	6
grown	244	6
a	245	6
bit	246	6
the	247	6
next	248	6
day	249	6
at	250	6
breakfast.	251	6
'Just	252	6
as	253	6
well	254	6
if	255	6
he's	256	6
going	257	6
to	258	6
be	259	6
gobbled	260	6
up	261	6
like	262	6
that,'	263	6
her	264	6
mom	265	6
responded	266	6
who	267	6
was	268	6
busy	269	6
preparing	270	6
breakfast.	271	6
Abby	272	6
whined	273	6
that	274	6
she	275	6
didn't	276	6
want	277	6
him	278	6
to	279	6
get	280	6
too	281	6
big	282	6
or	283	6
he	284	6
wouldn't	285	6
be	286	6
cute	287	6
anymore.	288	6
'Small	289	6
things,	290	6
not	291	6
big	292	6
things,	293	6
are	294	6
cute,	295	6
right?'	296	6
she	297	6
asked,	298	6
half	299	6
to	300	6
herself.	301	6
The	302	6
next	303	6
day	304	6
in	305	6
art	306	6
class,	307	6
Abby	308	6
needed	309	6
two	310	6
pieces	311	6
of	312	6
paper	313	6
that	314	6
were	315	6
very	316	6
expensive,	317	6
to	318	6
draw	319	6
an	320	6
elephant,	321	6
but	322	6
the	323	6
teacher	324	6
didn't	325	6
mind	326	6
Abby	327	6
using	328	6
the	329	6
expensive	330	6
paper	331	6
because	332	6
she	333	6
was	334	6
pleased	335	6
with	336	6
the	337	6
drawing	338	6
and	339	6
wanted	340	6
it	341	6
on	342	6
the	343	6
wall.	344	6
The	345	6
teacher,	346	6
who	347	6
was	348	6
always	349	6
very	350	6
encouraging,	351	6
remarked	352	6
that	353	6
the	354	6
drawing	355	6
Abby	356	6
had	357	6
made	358	6
was	359	6
very	360	6
creative	361	6
and	362	6
beamed	363	6
at	364	6
Abby,	365	6
giving	366	6
her	367	6
the	368	6
seal	369	6
of	370	6
approval.	371	6
Back	372	6
at	373	6
home,	374	6
Mom,	375	6
convinced	376	6
by	377	6
Abby	378	6
to	379	6
clean	380	6
out	381	6
the	382	6
tank,	383	6
was	384	6
cleaning	385	6
with	386	6
a	387	6
special	388	6
vacuum,	389	6
or	390	6
'hoover'.	391	6
'Where's	392	6
Mr.	393	6
Sticky?'	394	6
Abby	395	6
asked	396	6
first	397	6
thing	398	6
when	399	6
she	400	6
came	401	6
home	402	6
from	403	6
school.	404	6
'On	405	6
the	406	6
side,'	407	6
Mom	408	6
replied.	409	6
And	410	6
then	411	6
she	412	6
added,	413	6
'Don't	414	6
worry.	415	6
I	416	6
went	417	6
extra	418	6
slowly	419	6
since	420	6
it's	421	6
better	422	6
to	423	6
be	424	6
safe	425	6
than	426	6
sorry.'	427	6
Abby	428	6
looked	429	6
on	430	6
all	431	6
sides	432	6
of	433	6
the	434	6
tank,	435	6
but	436	6
there	437	6
was	438	6
no	439	6
sign	440	6
of	441	6
the	442	6
water	443	6
snail	444	6
that	445	6
she	446	6
had	447	6
discovered	448	6
a	449	6
couple	450	6
of	451	6
days	452	6
ago.	453	6
She	454	6
was	455	6
very	456	6
sad.	457	6
Her	458	6
mom	459	6
said	460	6
to	461	6
wait	462	6
a	463	6
few	464	6
hours	465	6
until	466	6
the	467	6
water	468	6
clears	469	6
to	470	6
take	471	6
another	472	6
careful	473	6
look.	474	6
That	475	6
evening,	476	6
Abby	477	6
went	478	6
up	479	6
to	480	6
her	481	6
bedroom	482	6
to	483	6
check	484	6
the	485	6
tank	486	6
again.	487	6
The	488	6
water	489	6
had	490	6
settled	491	6
and	492	6
looked	493	6
clear,	494	6
but	495	6
Abby	496	6
could	497	6
not	498	6
see	499	6
Mr.	500	6
Sticky.	501	6
Abby	502	6
kneeled	503	6
down	504	6
to	505	6
have	506	6
another	507	6
look	508	6
in	509	6
the	510	6
tank	511	6
that	512	6
her	513	6
mom	514	6
had	515	6
cleared	516	6
so	517	6
thoroughly,	518	6
but	519	6
Mr.	520	6
Sticky	521	6
was	522	6
still	523	6
nowhere	524	6
to	525	6
be	526	6
found.	527	6
Abby	528	6
was	529	6
a	530	6
bundle	531	6
of	532	6
nerves	533	6
as	534	6
she	535	6
descended	536	6
the	537	6
stairs.	538	6
In	539	6
the	540	6
study,	541	6
surrounded	542	6
by	543	6
books	544	6
and	545	6
papers,	546	6
her	547	6
mom	548	6
was	549	6
working	550	6
and	551	6
she	552	6
looked	553	6
impatient	554	6
when	555	6
she	556	6
saw	557	6
Abby	558	6
in	559	6
the	560	6
doorway	561	6
and	562	6
even	563	6
more	564	6
worried	565	6
when	566	6
she	567	6
heard	568	6
the	569	6
bad	570	6
news.	571	6
'He'll	572	6
turn	573	6
up,'	574	6
Mom	575	6
said,	576	6
and	577	6
that	578	6
was	579	6
that.	580	6
Then,	581	6
to	582	6
add	583	6
fuel	584	6
to	585	6
the	586	6
flames,	587	6
she	588	6
raised	589	6
her	590	6
tone	591	6
of	592	6
voice	593	6
and	594	6
said	595	6
dismissively,	596	6
'For	597	6
the	598	6
time	599	6
being,	600	6
go	601	6
to	602	6
bed,	603	6
Abby.	604	6
I've	605	6
got	606	6
masses	607	6
of	608	6
work	609	6
to	610	6
catch	611	6
up	612	6
on.'	613	6
Abby	614	6
had	615	6
a	616	6
quick	617	6
temper	618	6
and	619	6
she	620	6
was	621	6
angry	622	6
as	623	6
hell.	624	6
'You've	625	6
hoovered	626	6
him	627	6
up,	628	6
haven't	629	6
you?'	630	6
she	631	6
said	632	6
accusingly.	633	6
Abby's	634	6
mom	635	6
denied	636	6
Abby's	637	6
version	638	6
of	639	6
the	640	6
story	641	6
was	642	6
true	643	6
and	644	6
said	645	6
that	646	6
she	647	6
was	648	6
careful,	649	6
but	650	6
because	651	6
Mr.	652	6
Sticky	653	6
was	654	6
so	655	6
small	656	6
he	657	6
was	658	6
hard	659	6
to	660	6
see.	661	6
'What's	662	6
wrong	663	6
with	664	6
being	665	6
small?'	666	6
'Nothing	667	6
at	668	6
all,	669	6
but	670	6
it	671	6
makes	672	6
things	673	6
hard	674	6
to	675	6
find.'	676	6
'Or	677	6
notice,'	678	6
Abby	679	6
said,	680	6
suddenly	681	6
feeling	682	6
like	683	6
the	684	6
small,	685	6
overlooked	686	6
Mr.	687	6
Sticky	688	6
herself	689	6
and	690	6
storming	691	6
from	692	6
the	693	6
room.	694	6
The	695	6
door	696	6
to	697	6
the	698	6
bedroom	699	6
opened	700	6
a	701	6
few	702	6
minutes	703	6
later	704	6
and	705	6
Mom's	706	6
face	707	6
appeared.	708	6
She	709	6
was	710	6
there	711	6
to	712	6
try	713	6
to	714	6
make	715	6
up	716	6
for	717	6
having	718	6
been	719	6
insensitive	720	6
earlier.	721	6
She	722	6
had	723	6
put	724	6
her	725	6
work	726	6
on	727	6
the	728	6
back	729	6
burner	730	6
and	731	6
occupied	732	6
herself	733	6
with	734	6
Sticky.	735	6
Abby,	736	6
who	737	6
was	738	6
breathing	739	6
fire	740	6
all	741	6
on	742	6
account	743	6
of	744	6
the	745	6
little	746	6
snail,	747	6
tried	748	6
to	749	6
ignore	750	6
her,	751	6
but	752	6
it	753	6
was	754	6
hard	755	6
when	756	6
Mom	757	6
walked	758	6
over	759	6
to	760	6
the	761	6
bed	762	6
and	763	6
sat	764	6
next	765	6
to	766	6
her.	767	6
Mom,	768	6
who	769	6
Abby	770	6
still	771	6
strained	772	6
to	773	6
remain	774	6
upset	775	6
with,	776	6
had	777	6
gone	778	6
out	779	6
to	780	6
find	781	6
her	782	6
glasses	783	6
in	784	6
order	785	6
to	786	6
search	787	6
for	788	6
Sticky	789	6
more	790	6
effectively.	791	6
'This	792	6
is	793	6
my	794	6
new	795	6
and	796	6
extra	797	6
powerful	798	6
pair	799	6
I	800	6
have	801	6
for	802	6
important	803	6
occasions	804	6
like	805	6
snail	806	6
hunting,'	807	6
she	808	6
said.	809	6
She	810	6
smiled	811	6
at	812	6
Abby,	813	6
trying	814	6
to	815	6
butter	816	6
her	817	6
up,	818	6
but	819	6
Abby	820	6
didn't	821	6
smile	822	6
back.	823	6
Abby	824	6
believed	825	6
her	826	6
mom's	827	6
idea	828	6
would	829	6
not	830	6
succeed,	831	6
but	832	6
then	833	6
she	834	6
had	835	6
an	836	6
idea	837	6
of	838	6
her	839	6
own.	840	6
'I've	841	6
got	842	6
a	843	6
magnifying	844	6
glass,'	845	6
Abby	846	6
suddenly	847	6
remembered	848	6
and	849	6
rushed	850	6
off	851	6
to	852	6
find	853	6
it.	854	6
On	855	6
the	856	6
floor	857	6
beside	858	6
each	859	6
other	860	6
they	861	6
sat,	862	6
shuffling	863	6
around	864	6
the	865	6
tank,	866	6
looking	867	6
all	868	6
over	869	6
the	870	6
place	871	6
and	872	6
peering	873	6
into	874	6
the	875	6
corners	876	6
among	877	6
the	878	6
big	879	6
pebbles	880	6
and	881	6
the	882	6
pond	883	6
weed.	884	6
Abby	885	6
tried	886	6
to	887	6
imagine,	888	6
if	889	6
she	890	6
were	891	6
Sticky,	892	6
a	893	6
little	894	6
water	895	6
snail,	896	6
where	897	6
would	898	6
she	899	6
hide	900	6
out?	901	6
At	902	6
one	903	6
point	904	6
she	905	6
thought	906	6
she	907	6
saw	908	6
him,	909	6
but	910	6
it	911	6
wasn't	912	6
the	913	6
water	914	6
snail.	915	6
It	916	6
was	917	6
a	918	6
large	919	6
speck	920	6
of	921	6
dust	922	6
that	923	6
was	924	6
deceptively	925	6
bobbing	926	6
around	927	6
in	928	6
the	929	6
water	930	6
like	931	6
a	932	6
live	933	6
animal.	934	6
They	935	6
were	936	6
ready	937	6
to	938	6
call	939	6
it	940	6
quits,	941	6
when	942	6
suddenly	943	6
Mom	944	6
cried,	945	6
'Ah	946	6
ha!'	947	6
Tucked	948	6
in	949	6
a	950	6
curve	951	6
of	952	6
the	953	6
archway,	954	6
perfectly	955	6
hidden	956	6
against	957	6
a	958	6
pitch	959	6
dark	960	6
stone,	961	6
sat	962	6
Mr.	963	6
Sticky,	964	6
safe	965	6
and	966	6
sound.	967	6
'You,	968	6
I	969	6
can	970	6
always	971	6
count	972	6
on,'	973	6
Abby	974	6
said	975	6
to	976	6
her	977	6
mom,	978	6
with	979	6
relief.	980	6
Then	981	6
she	982	6
noticed	983	6
another	984	6
water	985	6
snail	986	6
was	987	6
right	988	6
next	989	6
to	990	6
Sticky	991	6
and	992	6
asked	993	6
where	994	6
this	995	6
new	996	6
addition	997	6
to	998	6
the	999	6
family	1000	6
could	1001	6
have	1002	6
come	1003	6
from.	1004	6
'I'm	1005	6
beginning	1006	6
to	1007	6
suspect	1008	6
the	1009	6
pond	1010	6
weed	1011	6
is	1012	6
guilty,	1013	6
don't	1014	6
you	1015	6
think?'	1016	6
replied	1017	6
Mom.	1018	6
They	1019	6
both	1020	6
laughed	1021	6
and	1022	6
climbed	1023	6
into	1024	6
Abby's	1025	6
bed	1026	6
together	1027	6
and,	1028	6
though	1029	6
it	1030	6
was	1031	6
cozy,	1032	6
it	1033	6
was	1034	6
a	1035	6
bit	1036	6
of	1037	6
a	1038	6
squeeze.	1039	6
'Budge	1040	6
up,'	1041	6
Mom	1042	6
said,	1043	6
giving	1044	6
Abby	1045	6
a	1046	6
push	1047	6
with	1048	6
her	1049	6
bottom.	1050	6
'I	1051	6
can't	1052	6
because	1053	6
I'm	1054	6
already	1055	6
on	1056	6
the	1057	6
edge.'	1058	6
'Good	1059	6
heavens,	1060	6
you've	1061	6
grown	1062	6
then.	1063	6
When	1064	6
did	1065	6
that	1066	6
happen?	1067	6
You	1068	6
could've	1069	6
put	1070	6
an	1071	6
elephant	1072	6
in	1073	6
here	1074	6
last	1075	6
time	1076	6
we	1077	6
did	1078	6
this.	1079	6
Before	1080	6
I	1081	6
know	1082	6
it,	1083	6
you'll	1084	6
be	1085	6
all	1086	6
grown	1087	6
up.'	1088	6
On	1089	6
her	1090	6
mom's	1091	6
chest	1092	6
Abby	1093	6
then	1094	6
put	1095	6
her	1096	6
head	1097	6
and	1098	6
smiled.	1099	6
The	1	7
text	2	7
message	3	7
said	4	7
that	5	7
Lucy	6	7
Josephs	7	7
was	8	7
a	9	7
failure.	10	7
It	11	7
said	12	7
she	13	7
was	14	7
ugly,	15	7
had	16	7
no	17	7
style	18	7
and	19	7
the	20	7
world	21	7
hated	22	7
her.	23	7
At	24	7
least	25	7
that	26	7
was	27	7
what	28	7
it	29	7
said	30	7
to	31	7
Lucy.	32	7
It	33	7
said	34	7
that	35	7
and	36	7
a	37	7
whole	38	7
lot	39	7
more	40	7
that	41	7
she	42	7
was	43	7
struggling	44	7
to	45	7
understand.	46	7
The	47	7
actual	48	7
text	49	7
of	50	7
the	51	7
note	52	7
said	53	7
that	54	7
Lucy	55	7
better	56	7
not	57	7
show	58	7
up	59	7
at	60	7
the	61	7
party	62	7
tonight,	63	7
because	64	7
it	65	7
was	66	7
going	67	7
to	68	7
be	69	7
bad	70	7
enough	71	7
already!	72	7
Lucy,	73	7
who	74	7
had	75	7
started	76	7
receiving	77	7
these	78	7
messages	79	7
a	80	7
few	81	7
weeks	82	7
ago,	83	7
tapped	84	7
the	85	7
mobile	86	7
screen	87	7
to	88	7
make	89	7
the	90	7
message	91	7
disappear	92	7
from	93	7
view.	94	7
She	95	7
only	96	7
wished	97	7
it	98	7
was	99	7
as	100	7
easy	101	7
to	102	7
tap	103	7
her	104	7
heart	105	7
and	106	7
erase	107	7
the	108	7
trace	109	7
the	110	7
message	111	7
had	112	7
left	113	7
there.	114	7
'Was	115	7
that	116	7
another	117	7
one	118	7
of	119	7
those	120	7
messages?'	121	7
her	122	7
mom	123	7
asked,	124	7
who	125	7
was	126	7
driving	127	7
the	128	7
car.	129	7
Lucy	130	7
confirmed	131	7
her	132	7
mother's	133	7
suspicion	134	7
was	135	7
founded	136	7
as	137	7
she	138	7
answered	139	7
dejectedly,	140	7
'I'm	141	7
sorry	142	7
to	143	7
say	144	7
it	145	7
was.'	146	7
'Haven't	147	7
you	148	7
reported	149	7
it	150	7
yet?'	151	7
asked	152	7
Jill,	153	7
Lucy's	154	7
older	155	7
sister	156	7
who	157	7
was	158	7
sitting	159	7
in	160	7
the	161	7
passenger	162	7
seat.	163	7
'Yes,'	164	7
Lucy	165	7
replied,	166	7
lying	167	7
through	168	7
her	169	7
teeth.	170	7
That	171	7
Lucy	172	7
should	173	7
not	174	7
let	175	7
the	176	7
messages	177	7
get	178	7
to	179	7
her	180	7
and	181	7
that	182	7
the	183	7
sender	184	7
was	185	7
only	186	7
jealous	187	7
were	188	7
Lucy's	189	7
mom's	190	7
arguments,	191	7
in	192	7
an	193	7
effort	194	7
to	195	7
comfort	196	7
her	197	7
daughter.	198	7
Lucy's	199	7
mom	200	7
suddenly	201	7
felt	202	7
guilty,	203	7
for	204	7
she	205	7
had	206	7
been	207	7
the	208	7
one	209	7
to	210	7
buy	211	7
the	212	7
phone	213	7
for	214	7
Lucy	215	7
just	216	7
a	217	7
couple	218	7
of	219	7
months	220	7
ago.	221	7
She	222	7
then	223	7
admitted	224	7
her	225	7
regret	226	7
about	227	7
the	228	7
phone	229	7
was	230	7
still	231	7
bugging	232	7
her	233	7
out	234	7
loud	235	7
as	236	7
she	237	7
sighed,	238	7
'I	239	7
never	240	7
should	241	7
have	242	7
given	243	7
you	244	7
that	245	7
phone	246	7
Lucy.'	247	7
'No,	248	7
it's	249	7
fine.	250	7
I	251	7
love	252	7
it,'	253	7
said	254	7
Lucy	255	7
knowing	256	7
that	257	7
affording	258	7
the	259	7
phone	260	7
had	261	7
been	262	7
no	263	7
small	264	7
thing	265	7
for	266	7
her	267	7
mother.	268	7
It	269	7
had	270	7
been	271	7
nothing	272	7
but	273	7
trouble	274	7
though.	275	7
Lucy	276	7
did	277	7
not	278	7
know	279	7
who	280	7
it	281	7
was	282	7
that	283	7
was	284	7
sending	285	7
her	286	7
the	287	7
messages,	288	7
and	289	7
she	290	7
did	291	7
not	292	7
know	293	7
how	294	7
they	295	7
had	296	7
got	297	7
her	298	7
number,	299	7
but	300	7
whoever	301	7
it	302	7
was,	303	7
he	304	7
or	305	7
she	306	7
had	307	7
slowly	308	7
taken	309	7
over	310	7
Lucy's	311	7
life.	312	7
She	313	7
was	314	7
getting	315	7
several	316	7
texts	317	7
a	318	7
day	319	7
now,	320	7
all	321	7
of	322	7
which	323	7
were	324	7
abusive	325	7
and	326	7
hurtful.	327	7
Lucy	328	7
wondered	329	7
what	330	7
the	331	7
person	332	7
who	333	7
was	334	7
messaging	335	7
her	336	7
might	337	7
be	338	7
thinking	339	7
or	340	7
trying	341	7
to	342	7
achieve	343	7
with	344	7
all	345	7
of	346	7
their	347	7
hateful	348	7
messages.	349	7
As	350	7
the	351	7
car	352	7
pulled	353	7
up	354	7
outside	355	7
the	356	7
school,	357	7
which	358	7
looked	359	7
like	360	7
a	361	7
large	362	7
shadow	363	7
in	364	7
the	365	7
darkness	366	7
of	367	7
a	368	7
November	369	7
evening,	370	7
Lucy	371	7
felt	372	7
a	373	7
shiver	374	7
run	375	7
down	376	7
her	377	7
spine.	378	7
Hastened	379	7
by	380	7
Jill,	381	7
who	382	7
did	383	7
not	384	7
want	385	7
to	386	7
be	387	7
late	388	7
to	389	7
her	390	7
own	391	7
concert,	392	7
Lucy	393	7
hesitantly	394	7
stepped	395	7
out	396	7
of	397	7
the	398	7
car	399	7
and	400	7
walked	401	7
toward	402	7
the	403	7
school.	404	7
It	405	7
was	406	7
Jill	407	7
who	408	7
in	409	7
her	410	7
final	411	7
year	412	7
of	413	7
high	414	7
school	415	7
had	416	7
become	417	7
involved	418	7
in	419	7
helping	420	7
organize	421	7
this	422	7
year's	423	7
school	424	7
talent	425	7
show,	426	7
and	427	7
she	428	7
took	429	7
her	430	7
position	431	7
very	432	7
seriously.	433	7
Lucy	434	7
hurried	435	7
behind	436	7
Jill,	437	7
pulling	438	7
on	439	7
the	440	7
worn,	441	7
oversized	442	7
coat	443	7
that	444	7
had	445	7
originally	446	7
belonged	447	7
to	448	7
Jill,	449	7
in	450	7
order	451	7
to	452	7
keep	453	7
her	454	7
dry	455	7
as	456	7
the	457	7
raindrops	458	7
fell	459	7
all	460	7
around	461	7
them.	462	7
As	463	7
the	464	7
sisters	465	7
entered	466	7
the	467	7
hall	468	7
where	469	7
the	470	7
show	471	7
was	472	7
to	473	7
take	474	7
place,	475	7
Jill	476	7
filled	477	7
with	478	7
excitement	479	7
while	480	7
Lucy	481	7
regretted	482	7
that	483	7
she	484	7
had	485	7
promised	486	7
her	487	7
mother	488	7
she	489	7
would	490	7
participate	491	7
in	492	7
the	493	7
show.	494	7
'To	495	7
waste	496	7
your	497	7
talent	498	7
would	499	7
be	500	7
a	501	7
real	502	7
shame,	503	7
for	504	7
you	505	7
have	506	7
such	507	7
a	508	7
beautiful	509	7
voice,'	510	7
her	511	7
mother	512	7
had	513	7
argued	514	7
two	515	7
months	516	7
back,	517	7
when	518	7
the	519	7
concert	520	7
was	521	7
first	522	7
announced.	523	7
Lucy	524	7
had	525	7
been	526	7
considering	527	7
it,	528	7
for	529	7
she	530	7
did	531	7
love	532	7
to	533	7
sing.	534	7
That	535	7
very	536	7
night,	537	7
the	538	7
first	539	7
text	540	7
message	541	7
had	542	7
come	543	7
through.	544	7
'How	545	7
does	546	7
it	547	7
feel	548	7
to	549	7
be	550	7
tall	551	7
and	552	7
lanky	553	7
like	554	7
a	555	7
giraffe?'	556	7
it	557	7
had	558	7
asked,	559	7
taking	560	7
Lucy	561	7
by	562	7
surprise.	563	7
One	564	7
of	565	7
the	566	7
popular	567	7
girls,	568	7
Lucy	569	7
had	570	7
always	571	7
known	572	7
she	573	7
wasn't,	574	7
but	575	7
before	576	7
the	577	7
messages	578	7
began,	579	7
Lucy	580	7
had	581	7
always	582	7
been	583	7
quite	584	7
proud	585	7
of	586	7
being	587	7
a	588	7
little	589	7
different.	590	7
But	591	7
text	592	7
by	593	7
text,	594	7
Lucy's	595	7
self-confidence	596	7
had	597	7
deflated	598	7
and,	599	7
in	600	7
the	601	7
end,	602	7
it	603	7
had	604	7
taken	605	7
some	606	7
doing	607	7
to	608	7
get	609	7
her	610	7
to	611	7
agree	612	7
to	613	7
perform	614	7
in	615	7
the	616	7
show.	617	7
Now,	618	7
however,	619	7
Lucy	620	7
had	621	7
no	622	7
choice	623	7
but	624	7
to	625	7
make	626	7
her	627	7
way	628	7
towards	629	7
the	630	7
stage	631	7
where	632	7
Jill	633	7
was	634	7
beckoning	635	7
encouragingly	636	7
to	637	7
her.	638	7
She	639	7
was	640	7
the	641	7
first	642	7
performer.	643	7
Lucy,	644	7
announced	645	7
by	646	7
her	647	7
sister	648	7
to	649	7
the	650	7
audience,	651	7
was	652	7
all	653	7
nerves	654	7
as	655	7
she	656	7
walked	657	7
out	658	7
onto	659	7
the	660	7
middle	661	7
of	662	7
the	663	7
stage,	664	7
where	665	7
there	666	7
was	667	7
nothing	668	7
but	669	7
a	670	7
microphone	671	7
and	672	7
her.	673	7
She	674	7
heard	675	7
the	676	7
audience	677	7
applaud	678	7
and	679	7
could	680	7
feel	681	7
a	682	7
sense	683	7
of	684	7
anticipation	685	7
emanate	686	7
from	687	7
the	688	7
other	689	7
side	690	7
of	691	7
the	692	7
heavy	693	7
curtain.	694	7
As	695	7
the	696	7
curtains	697	7
began	698	7
to	699	7
part,	700	7
she	701	7
cast	702	7
a	703	7
worried	704	7
look	705	7
at	706	7
Jill	707	7
in	708	7
the	709	7
wings,	710	7
who	711	7
assured	712	7
her	713	7
with	714	7
a	715	7
positive	716	7
thumbs	717	7
up.	718	7
Lucy	719	7
thought	720	7
to	721	7
herself	722	7
that	723	7
she	724	7
could	725	7
not	726	7
go	727	7
through	728	7
with	729	7
this	730	7
and	731	7
that	732	7
she,	733	7
unlike	734	7
her	735	7
older	736	7
sister,	737	7
was	738	7
not	739	7
confident	740	7
enough	741	7
to	742	7
put	743	7
herself	744	7
before	745	7
the	746	7
judging	747	7
audience.	748	7
The	749	7
crowd	750	7
looked	751	7
up	752	7
at	753	7
her	754	7
and	755	7
Lucy	756	7
was	757	7
ready	758	7
to	759	7
run	760	7
when	761	7
the	762	7
first	763	7
notes	764	7
of	765	7
the	766	7
music	767	7
sounded	768	7
out	769	7
and	770	7
a	771	7
sudden	772	7
calm	773	7
settled	774	7
over	775	7
her.	776	7
She	777	7
closed	778	7
her	779	7
eyes	780	7
and	781	7
shut	782	7
everything	783	7
out,	784	7
including	785	7
the	786	7
audience,	787	7
the	788	7
nerves	789	7
that	790	7
threatened	791	7
to	792	7
take	793	7
over,	794	7
the	795	7
text	796	7
messages,	797	7
and	798	7
the	799	7
way	800	7
they	801	7
made	802	7
her	803	7
feel.	804	7
It	805	7
was	806	7
just	807	7
her	808	7
and	809	7
the	810	7
music,	811	7
and	812	7
it	813	7
was	814	7
a	815	7
love	816	7
story	817	7
that	818	7
had	819	7
been	820	7
going	821	7
on	822	7
her	823	7
whole	824	7
life.	825	7
She	826	7
began	827	7
to	828	7
sing,	829	7
and	830	7
all	831	7
the	832	7
pain	833	7
and	834	7
confusion	835	7
that	836	7
the	837	7
messages	838	7
had	839	7
been	840	7
causing	841	7
inside	842	7
her	843	7
just	844	7
flowed	845	7
out.	846	7
The	847	7
words	848	7
were	849	7
not	850	7
important,	851	7
for	852	7
it	853	7
was	854	7
the	855	7
feeling	856	7
behind	857	7
them	858	7
that	859	7
she	860	7
latched	861	7
onto.	862	7
Lucy	863	7
was	864	7
in	865	7
the	866	7
heart	867	7
of	868	7
the	869	7
song	870	7
with	871	7
the	872	7
rest	873	7
of	874	7
the	875	7
world	876	7
slipping	877	7
away.	878	7
When	879	7
the	880	7
song	881	7
finished	882	7
and	883	7
the	884	7
last	885	7
note	886	7
died	887	7
away,	888	7
she	889	7
opened	890	7
her	891	7
eyes.	892	7
To	893	7
see	894	7
the	895	7
whole	896	7
audience	897	7
on	898	7
their	899	7
feet	900	7
and	901	7
the	902	7
hall	903	7
filled	904	7
with	905	7
cheers	906	7
and	907	7
applause	908	7
was	909	7
not	910	7
what	911	7
Lucy	912	7
had	913	7
expected.	914	7
Lucy	915	7
allowed	916	7
herself	917	7
to	918	7
enjoy	919	7
the	920	7
sense	921	7
of	922	7
achievement	923	7
and	924	7
belonging	925	7
that	926	7
she	927	7
had	928	7
not	929	7
felt	930	7
in	931	7
a	932	7
very	933	7
long	934	7
time.	935	7
Then	936	7
she	937	7
saw	938	7
her	939	7
mother,	940	7
who	941	7
was	942	7
cheering	943	7
the	944	7
loudest	945	7
of	946	7
all	947	7
in	948	7
the	949	7
crowd,	950	7
and	951	7
Jill,	952	7
who	953	7
was	954	7
beaming	955	7
at	956	7
her	957	7
with	958	7
pride	959	7
from	960	7
the	961	7
wings.	962	7
She	963	7
knew	964	7
she	965	7
owed	966	7
them	967	7
big	968	7
time	969	7
for	970	7
reminding	971	7
her	972	7
what	973	7
she	974	7
was	975	7
capable	976	7
of	977	7
and	978	7
who	979	7
she	980	7
really	981	7
was.	982	7
The	983	7
next	984	7
time	985	7
her	986	7
phone	987	7
bleeped	988	7
she	989	7
would	990	7
tap	991	7
the	992	7
message	993	7
straight	994	7
into	995	7
oblivion	996	7
where	997	7
it	998	7
belonged.	999	7
The	1	8
Roswell	2	8
UFO	3	8
Incident	4	8
was	5	8
the	6	8
alleged	7	8
recovery	8	8
of	9	8
extra-terrestrial	10	8
debris,	11	8
including	12	8
alien	13	8
corpses,	14	8
from	15	8
an	16	8
object	17	8
that	18	8
crashed	19	8
near	20	8
Roswell,	21	8
New	22	8
Mexico,	23	8
on	24	8
or	25	8
about	26	8
July	27	8
eighth,	28	8
nineteen	29	8
forty-seven.	30	8
Since	31	8
the	32	8
late	33	8
nineteen	34	8
seventies,	35	8
the	36	8
incident	37	8
has	38	8
been	39	8
the	40	8
subject	41	8
of	42	8
intense	43	8
controversy	44	8
and	45	8
the	46	8
subject	47	8
of	48	8
conspiracy	49	8
theories	50	8
as	51	8
to	52	8
the	53	8
true	54	8
nature	55	8
of	56	8
the	57	8
object	58	8
that	59	8
crashed.	60	8
The	61	8
United	62	8
States	63	8
military	64	8
maintains	65	8
the	66	8
debris	67	8
recovered	68	8
was	69	8
from	70	8
an	71	8
experimental	72	8
high-altitude	73	8
surveillance	74	8
balloon	75	8
that	76	8
belonged	77	8
to	78	8
a	79	8
classified	80	8
program	81	8
named	82	8
'Mogul'.	83	8
However,	84	8
many	85	8
UFO	86	8
proponents	87	8
maintain	88	8
that,	89	8
in	90	8
fact,	91	8
a	92	8
crashed	93	8
alien	94	8
craft	95	8
and	96	8
bodies	97	8
were	98	8
recovered,	99	8
and	100	8
that	101	8
the	102	8
military	103	8
then	104	8
engaged	105	8
in	106	8
a	107	8
cover-up.	108	8
The	109	8
incident	110	8
has	111	8
turned	112	8
into	113	8
a	114	8
widely	115	8
known	116	8
pop	117	8
culture	118	8
phenomenon,	119	8
making	120	8
the	121	8
name	122	8
Roswell	123	8
synonymous	124	8
with	125	8
UFOs.	126	8
It	127	8
ranks	128	8
as	129	8
one	130	8
of	131	8
the	132	8
most	133	8
publicized	134	8
and	135	8
controversial	136	8
alleged	137	8
UFO	138	8
incidents.	139	8
On	140	8
July	141	8
ninth,	142	8
nineteen	143	8
forty-seven,	144	8
a	145	8
press	146	8
release	147	8
that	148	8
Roswell	149	8
Army	150	8
Air	151	8
Field	152	8
issued	153	8
stated	154	8
that	155	8
personnel	156	8
from	157	8
the	158	8
field's	159	8
Bomb	160	8
Group	161	8
had	162	8
recovered	163	8
a	164	8
crashed	165	8
'flying	166	8
disc'	167	8
from	168	8
a	169	8
ranch	170	8
near	171	8
Roswell,	172	8
sparking	173	8
intense	174	8
media	175	8
interest.	176	8
Later	177	8
the	178	8
same	179	8
day,	180	8
the	181	8
Commanding	182	8
General	183	8
of	184	8
the	185	8
Eighth	186	8
Air	187	8
Force	188	8
stated	189	8
that,	190	8
in	191	8
fact,	192	8
a	193	8
weather	194	8
balloon	195	8
had	196	8
been	197	8
recovered	198	8
by	199	8
the	200	8
Roswell	201	8
Army	202	8
Air	203	8
Field	204	8
personnel,	205	8
rather	206	8
than	207	8
a	208	8
'flying	209	8
saucer'.	210	8
A	211	8
subsequent	212	8
press	213	8
conference	214	8
was	215	8
called,	216	8
featuring	217	8
debris	218	8
from	219	8
the	220	8
crashed	221	8
object	222	8
that	223	8
confirmed	224	8
the	225	8
weather	226	8
balloon	227	8
description.	228	8
The	229	8
case	230	8
was	231	8
quickly	232	8
forgotten	233	8
and	234	8
almost	235	8
completely	236	8
ignored,	237	8
even	238	8
by	239	8
UFO	240	8
researchers,	241	8
for	242	8
more	243	8
than	244	8
thirty	245	8
years.	246	8
Then,	247	8
in	248	8
nineteen	249	8
seventy-eight,	250	8
nuclear	251	8
physicist	252	8
and	253	8
author	254	8
Stanton	255	8
Friedman	256	8
interviewed	257	8
Jesse	258	8
Marcel,	259	8
the	260	8
only	261	8
person	262	8
known	263	8
to	264	8
have	265	8
accompanied	266	8
the	267	8
Roswell	268	8
debris	269	8
from	270	8
where	271	8
it	272	8
was	273	8
recovered	274	8
to	275	8
Fort	276	8
Worth.	277	8
Over	278	8
the	279	8
next	280	8
few	281	8
years,	282	8
the	283	8
accounts	284	8
he	285	8
and	286	8
others	287	8
gave	288	8
elevated	289	8
Roswell	290	8
from	291	8
a	292	8
forgotten	293	8
incident	294	8
to	295	8
perhaps	296	8
the	297	8
most	298	8
famous	299	8
UFO	300	8
case	301	8
of	302	8
all	303	8
time.	304	8
By	305	8
the	306	8
early	307	8
nineteen	308	8
nineties,	309	8
UFO	310	8
researchers	311	8
had	312	8
interviewed	313	8
several	314	8
hundred	315	8
people	316	8
who	317	8
had,	318	8
or	319	8
who	320	8
claimed	321	8
to	322	8
have	323	8
had,	324	8
a	325	8
connection	326	8
with	327	8
the	328	8
events	329	8
at	330	8
Roswell	331	8
in	332	8
nineteen	333	8
forty-seven.	334	8
Additionally,	335	8
hundreds	336	8
of	337	8
documents	338	8
were	339	8
obtained	340	8
by	341	8
Freedom	342	8
of	343	8
Information	344	8
Act	345	8
requests,	346	8
as	347	8
were	348	8
some	349	8
that	350	8
insiders	351	8
apparently	352	8
leaked.	353	8
Their	354	8
conclusions	355	8
were	356	8
that	357	8
at	358	8
least	359	8
one	360	8
alien	361	8
craft	362	8
had	363	8
crashed	364	8
in	365	8
the	366	8
Roswell	367	8
vicinity,	368	8
that	369	8
aliens,	370	8
some	371	8
possibly	372	8
still	373	8
alive,	374	8
were	375	8
recovered,	376	8
and	377	8
that	378	8
a	379	8
massive	380	8
cover-up	381	8
of	382	8
any	383	8
knowledge	384	8
of	385	8
the	386	8
incident	387	8
was	388	8
put	389	8
in	390	8
place.	391	8
Numerous	392	8
books,	393	8
articles,	394	8
television	395	8
specials	396	8
and	397	8
even	398	8
a	399	8
made-for-TV	400	8
movie	401	8
brought	402	8
the	403	8
nineteen	404	8
forty-seven	405	8
incident	406	8
fame	407	8
and	408	8
notoriety,	409	8
so	410	8
that	411	8
by	412	8
the	413	8
mid	414	8
nineteen	415	8
nineties,	416	8
strong	417	8
majorities	418	8
in	419	8
polls,	420	8
such	421	8
as	422	8
a	423	8
nineteen	424	8
ninety-seven	425	8
CNN	426	8
Time	427	8
poll,	428	8
believed	429	8
that	430	8
aliens	431	8
had	432	8
visited	433	8
earth	434	8
and	435	8
specifically	436	8
that	437	8
aliens	438	8
had	439	8
landed	440	8
at	441	8
Roswell	442	8
and	443	8
the	444	8
government	445	8
was	446	8
covering	447	8
up	448	8
the	449	8
fact.	450	8
During	451	8
the	452	8
nineteen	453	8
eighties	454	8
and	455	8
nineteen	456	8
nineties,	457	8
a	458	8
new	459	8
narrative	460	8
emerged	461	8
which	462	8
was	463	8
at	464	8
strong	465	8
odds	466	8
with	467	8
what	468	8
was	469	8
reported	470	8
in	471	8
nineteen	472	8
forty-seven.	473	8
This	474	8
narrative	475	8
evolved	476	8
over	477	8
the	478	8
years	479	8
from	480	8
the	481	8
time	482	8
the	483	8
first	484	8
book	485	8
on	486	8
Roswell	487	8
was	488	8
published	489	8
in	490	8
nineteen	491	8
eighty,	492	8
as	493	8
many	494	8
new	495	8
witnesses	496	8
and	497	8
accounts	498	8
emerged,	499	8
drawn	500	8
out	501	8
in	502	8
part	503	8
by	504	8
the	505	8
publicity	506	8
on	507	8
the	508	8
incident.	509	8
Of	510	8
the	511	8
hundreds	512	8
of	513	8
witnesses	514	8
that	515	8
the	516	8
various	517	8
researchers	518	8
interviewed,	519	8
a	520	8
seemingly	521	8
impressive	522	8
figure,	523	8
a	524	8
comparable	525	8
few	526	8
were	527	8
true	528	8
'witnesses'	529	8
who	530	8
claimed	531	8
to	532	8
have	533	8
actually	534	8
seen	535	8
debris	536	8
or	537	8
aliens.	538	8
Most	539	8
of	540	8
these	541	8
so-called	542	8
witnesses	543	8
were	544	8
repeating	545	8
the	546	8
claims	547	8
of	548	8
others,	549	8
and	550	8
their	551	8
testimony	552	8
would	553	8
be	554	8
inadmissible	555	8
hearsay	556	8
in	557	8
an	558	8
American	559	8
court.	560	8
As	561	8
for	562	8
the	563	8
several	564	8
accounts	565	8
from	566	8
those	567	8
who	568	8
claimed	569	8
to	570	8
have	571	8
seen	572	8
aliens,	573	8
critics	574	8
identified	575	8
a	576	8
variety	577	8
of	578	8
problems	579	8
with	580	8
them.	581	8
These	582	8
problems	583	8
ranged	584	8
from	585	8
the	586	8
reliability	587	8
of	588	8
second-hand	589	8
accounts,	590	8
to	591	8
serious	592	8
credibility	593	8
problems	594	8
with	595	8
witnesses	596	8
making	597	8
demonstrably	598	8
false	599	8
or	600	8
internally-inconsistent	601	8
claims,	602	8
to	603	8
dubious	604	8
death-bed	605	8
'confessions'	606	8
or	607	8
accounts	608	8
from	609	8
elderly	610	8
or	611	8
easily	612	8
confused	613	8
witnesses.	614	8
A	615	8
basic	616	8
problem	617	8
with	618	8
all	619	8
the	620	8
witness	621	8
accounts,	622	8
according	623	8
to	624	8
the	625	8
critics,	626	8
is	627	8
that	628	8
they	629	8
all	630	8
came	631	8
a	632	8
minimum	633	8
of	634	8
thirty-one	635	8
years	636	8
after	637	8
the	638	8
events	639	8
in	640	8
question,	641	8
and	642	8
in	643	8
many	644	8
cases	645	8
were	646	8
recounted	647	8
more	648	8
than	649	8
forty	650	8
years	651	8
after	652	8
the	653	8
fact.	654	8
Not	655	8
only	656	8
are	657	8
memories	658	8
this	659	8
old	660	8
of	661	8
dubious	662	8
reliability,	663	8
they	664	8
were	665	8
also	666	8
subject	667	8
to	668	8
contamination	669	8
from	670	8
other	671	8
accounts	672	8
the	673	8
witnesses	674	8
may	675	8
have	676	8
been	677	8
exposed	678	8
to.	679	8
Though	680	8
there	681	8
had	682	8
always	683	8
been	684	8
skeptics	685	8
who	686	8
had	687	8
many	688	8
objections	689	8
to	690	8
the	691	8
plausibility	692	8
of	693	8
these	694	8
accounts,	695	8
it	696	8
was	697	8
not	698	8
until	699	8
the	700	8
mid	701	8
nineteen	702	8
nineties	703	8
that	704	8
a	705	8
strong	706	8
counter-argument	707	8
to	708	8
the	709	8
presence	710	8
of	711	8
aliens	712	8
was	713	8
widely	714	8
publicized.	715	8
The	716	8
General	717	8
Accounting	718	8
Office	719	8
launched	720	8
an	721	8
inquiry	722	8
and	723	8
directed	724	8
the	725	8
Office	726	8
of	727	8
the	728	8
Secretary	729	8
of	730	8
the	731	8
Air	732	8
Force	733	8
to	734	8
conduct	735	8
an	736	8
internal	737	8
investigation.	738	8
The	739	8
result	740	8
was	741	8
summarized	742	8
in	743	8
two	744	8
reports.	745	8
The	746	8
first,	747	8
released	748	8
in	749	8
nineteen	750	8
ninety-five,	751	8
concluded	752	8
that	753	8
the	754	8
reported	755	8
recovered	756	8
material	757	8
in	758	8
nineteen	759	8
forty-seven	760	8
was	761	8
likely	762	8
debris	763	8
from	764	8
a	765	8
secret	766	8
government	767	8
program	768	8
called	769	8
Project	770	8
Mogul,	771	8
which	772	8
involved	773	8

The	791	8

two	795	8
years	796	8
later,	797	8
in	798	8

concluded	801	8
that	802	8

various	845	8

perpetrated.	850	8
The	851	8

compression	856	8
and	857	8
confusion	858	8
about	859	8
when	860	8
events	861	8
occurred	862	8
explained	863	8
the	864	8
discrepancy	865	8
with	866	8
the	867	8
years	868	8
in	869	8
question.	870	8
In	871	8
January	872	8
nineteen	873	8
ninety-seven,	874	8
Karl	875	8
Pflock,	876	8
one	877	8
of	878	8
the	879	8
more	880	8
prominent	881	8
pro-UFO	882	8
researchers,	883	8
said,	884	8
'Based	885	8
on	886	8
my	887	8
research	888	8
and	889	8
that	890	8
of	891	8
others,	892	8
I'm	893	8
as	894	8
certain	895	8
as	896	8
it's	897	8
possible	898	8
to	899	8
be	900	8
without	901	8
absolute	902	8
proof,	903	8
that	904	8
no	905	8

Agustin	923	8
in	924	8
nineteen	925	8
forty-seven.'	926	8
He	927	8
then	928	8
added,	929	8
'The	930	8
debris	931	8
found	932	8
was	933	8
the	934	8
remains	935	8
of	936	8
something	937	8
very	938	8
earthly,	939	8
all	940	8

something	943	8

Mogul.'	949	8
Although	950	8
most	951	8
now	952	8
agree	953	8
with	954	8
this	955	8
conclusion,	956	8
each	957	8

Tulip	1	9
mania	2	9
was	3	9
a	4	9
period	5	9
in	6	9
the	7	9
Dutch	8	9
Golden	9	9
Age	10	9
during	11	9
which	12	9
contract	13	9
prices	14	9
for	15	9
bulbs	16	9
of	17	9
the	18	9
recently	19	9
introduced	20	9
tulip	21	9
reached	22	9
extraordinarily	23	9
high	24	9
levels	25	9
and	26	9
then	27	9
suddenly	28	9
collapsed.	29	9
At	30	9
the	31	9
peak	32	9
of	33	9
tulip	34	9
mania	35	9
in	36	9
February	37	9
sixteen	38	9
thirty-seven,	39	9
tulip	40	9
contracts	41	9
sold	42	9
for	43	9
more	44	9
than	45	9
ten	46	9
times	47	9
the	48	9
annual	49	9
income	50	9
of	51	9
a	52	9
skilled	53	9
craftsman.	54	9
It	55	9
is	56	9
generally	57	9
considered	58	9
the	59	9
first	60	9
recorded	61	9
economic	62	9
bubble.	63	9
The	64	9
tulip,	65	9
introduced	66	9
to	67	9
Europe	68	9
in	69	9
the	70	9
mid	71	9
sixteenth	72	9
century	73	9
from	74	9
the	75	9
Ottoman	76	9
Empire,	77	9
became	78	9
very	79	9
popular	80	9
in	81	9
the	82	9
United	83	9
Provinces,	84	9
which	85	9
we	86	9
now	87	9
know	88	9
as	89	9
the	90	9
Netherlands.	91	9
Tulip	92	9
cultivation	93	9
in	94	9
the	95	9
United	96	9
Provinces	97	9
is	98	9
generally	99	9
thought	100	9
to	101	9
have	102	9
started	103	9
in	104	9
earnest	105	9
around	106	9
fifteen	107	9
ninety-three,	108	9
after	109	9
the	110	9
Flemish	111	9
botanist	112	9
Charles	113	9
de	114	9
l'Ecluse	115	9
had	116	9
taken	117	9
up	118	9
a	119	9
post	120	9
at	121	9
the	122	9
University	123	9
of	124	9
Leiden	125	9
and	126	9
established	127	9
a	128	9
botanical	129	9
garden,	130	9
which	131	9
is	132	9
famous	133	9
as	134	9
one	135	9
of	136	9
the	137	9
oldest	138	9
in	139	9
the	140	9
world.	141	9
There,	142	9
he	143	9
planted	144	9
his	145	9
collection	146	9
of	147	9
tulip	148	9
bulbs	149	9
that	150	9
the	151	9
Emperor's	152	9
ambassador	153	9
sent	154	9
to	155	9
him	156	9
from	157	9
Turkey,	158	9
which	159	9
were	160	9
able	161	9
to	162	9
tolerate	163	9
the	164	9
harsher	165	9
conditions	166	9
of	167	9
the	168	9
northern	169	9
climate.	170	9
It	171	9
was	172	9
shortly	173	9
thereafter	174	9
that	175	9
the	176	9
tulips	177	9
began	178	9
to	179	9
grow	180	9
in	181	9
popularity.	182	9
The	183	9
flower	184	9
rapidly	185	9
became	186	9
a	187	9
coveted	188	9
luxury	189	9
item	190	9
and	191	9
a	192	9
status	193	9
symbol,	194	9
and	195	9
a	196	9
profusion	197	9
of	198	9
varieties	199	9
followed.	200	9
They	201	9
were	202	9
classified	203	9
in	204	9
groups:	205	9
one-colored	206	9
tulips	207	9
of	208	9
red,	209	9
yellow,	210	9
or	211	9
white	212	9
were	213	9
known	214	9
as	215	9
Couleren,	216	9
but	217	9
it	218	9
was	219	9
the	220	9
multicolored	221	9
Rosen	222	9
(red	223	9
or	224	9
pink	225	9
on	226	9
white	227	9
background),	228	9
Violetten	229	9
(purple	230	9
or	231	9
lilac	232	9
on	233	9
white	234	9
background),	235	9
and,	236	9
to	237	9
a	238	9
lesser	239	9
extent,	240	9
the	241	9
Bizarden	242	9
(red,	243	9
brown	244	9
or	245	9
purple	246	9
on	247	9
yellow	248	9
background)	249	9
that	250	9
were	251	9
the	252	9
most	253	9
popular.	254	9
These	255	9
spectacular	256	9
and	257	9
highly	258	9
sought-after	259	9
tulip	260	9
bulbs	261	9
would	262	9
grow	263	9
flowers	264	9
with	265	9
vivid	266	9
colors,	267	9
lines,	268	9
and	269	9
flames	270	9
on	271	9
the	272	9
petals,	273	9
as	274	9
a	275	9
result,	276	9
it	277	9
is	278	9
now	279	9
understood,	280	9
of	281	9
being	282	9
infected	283	9
with	284	9
tulip-specific	285	9
virus	286	9
known	287	9
as	288	9
the	289	9
'Tulip	290	9
breaking	291	9
virus'.	292	9
The	293	9
Dutch	294	9
Golden	295	9
Age	296	9
growers	297	9
named	298	9
their	299	9
new	300	9
varieties	301	9
with	302	9
exalted	303	9
titles.	304	9
Many	305	9
early	306	9
forms	307	9
were	308	9
prefixed	309	9
with	310	9
'admiral',	311	9
often	312	9
combined	313	9
with	314	9
the	315	9
growers'	316	9
names.	317	9
'General'	318	9
was	319	9
another	320	9
prefix	321	9
that	322	9
found	323	9
its	324	9
way	325	9
into	326	9
the	327	9
names	328	9
of	329	9
around	330	9
thirty	331	9
varieties.	332	9
Later	333	9
came	334	9
varieties	335	9
with	336	9
even	337	9
more	338	9
superb	339	9
names,	340	9
such	341	9
as	342	9
even	343	9
'Admiral	344	9
of	345	9
Admirals'	346	9
and	347	9
'General	348	9
of	349	9
Generals'.	350	9
Most	351	9
of	352	9
these	353	9
varieties	354	9
have	355	9
now	356	9
died	357	9
out,	358	9
though	359	9
similar	360	9
'broken'	361	9
tulips	362	9
continue	363	9
in	364	9
the	365	9
trade.	366	9
Tulips	367	9
grow	368	9
from	369	9
bulbs,	370	9
and	371	9
can	372	9
be	373	9
propagated	374	9
through	375	9
both	376	9
seeds	377	9
and	378	9
buds.	379	9
Seeds	380	9
from	381	9
a	382	9
tulip	383	9
will	384	9
form	385	9
a	386	9
flowering	387	9
bulb	388	9
after	389	9
seven-twelve	390	9
years.	391	9
When	392	9
a	393	9
bulb	394	9
grows	395	9
into	396	9
the	397	9
flower,	398	9
the	399	9
original	400	9
bulb	401	9
will	402	9
disappear,	403	9
but	404	9
a	405	9
clone	406	9
bulb	407	9
forms	408	9
in	409	9
its	410	9
place,	411	9
as	412	9
do	413	9
several	414	9
buds.	415	9
Properly	416	9
cultivated,	417	9
these	418	9
buds	419	9
will	420	9
become	421	9
bulbs	422	9
of	423	9
their	424	9
own.	425	9
The	426	9
'tulip	427	9
breaking'	428	9
virus,	429	9
which	430	9
many	431	9
botanists	432	9
have	433	9
studied,	434	9
spreads	435	9
only	436	9
through	437	9
buds,	438	9
not	439	9
seeds,	440	9
and	441	9
so	442	9
cultivating	443	9
the	444	9
most	445	9
appealing	446	9
varieties	447	9
takes	448	9
years.	449	9
Propagation	450	9
is	451	9
greatly	452	9
slowed	453	9
down	454	9
by	455	9
the	456	9
virus.	457	9
Tulips	458	9
bloom	459	9
in	460	9
April	461	9
and	462	9
May	463	9
for	464	9
about	465	9
a	466	9
week,	467	9
and	468	9
the	469	9
secondary	470	9
buds	471	9
appear	472	9
shortly	473	9
thereafter.	474	9
Bulbs	475	9
can	476	9
be	477	9
uprooted	478	9
and	479	9
moved	480	9
about	481	9
from	482	9
June	483	9
to	484	9
September,	485	9
and	486	9
thus	487	9
actual	488	9
purchases	489	9
occurred	490	9
during	491	9
these	492	9
months.	493	9
As	494	9
the	495	9
flowers	496	9
grew	497	9
in	498	9
popularity,	499	9
professional	500	9
growers	501	9
paid	502	9
higher	503	9
and	504	9
higher	505	9
prices	506	9
for	507	9
bulbs	508	9
with	509	9
the	510	9
virus.	511	9
By	512	9
sixteen	513	9
thirty-four,	514	9
in	515	9
part	516	9
as	517	9
a	518	9
result	519	9
of	520	9
demand	521	9
from	522	9
the	523	9
French,	524	9
speculators	525	9
began	526	9
to	527	9
enter	528	9
the	529	9
market.	530	9
In	531	9
sixteen	532	9
thirty-six,	533	9
the	534	9
Dutch	535	9
created	536	9
a	537	9
type	538	9
of	539	9
formal	540	9
futures	541	9
markets,	542	9
which	543	9
merchants	544	9
used	545	9
to	546	9
sell	547	9
and	548	9
buy	549	9
contracts	550	9
to	551	9
buy	552	9
bulbs	553	9
at	554	9
the	555	9
end	556	9
of	557	9
the	558	9
season.	559	9
Traders	560	9
met	561	9
at	562	9
taverns	563	9
and	564	9
buyers	565	9
were	566	9
required	567	9
to	568	9
pay	569	9
a	570	9
fee	571	9
per	572	9
trade.	573	9
People	574	9
were	575	9
purchasing	576	9
bulbs	577	9
at	578	9
higher	579	9
and	580	9
higher	581	9
prices,	582	9
intending	583	9
to	584	9
re-sell	585	9
them	586	9
for	587	9
a	588	9
profit.	589	9
However,	590	9
such	591	9
a	592	9
scheme	593	9
could	594	9
not	595	9
last	596	9
unless	597	9
someone	598	9
was	599	9
ultimately	600	9
willing	601	9
to	602	9
pay	603	9
such	604	9
high	605	9
prices	606	9
and	607	9
take	608	9
possession	609	9
of	610	9
the	611	9
bulbs.	612	9
In	613	9
February	614	9
sixteen	615	9
thirty-seven,	616	9
tulip	617	9
traders	618	9
could	619	9
no	620	9
longer	621	9
find	622	9
new	623	9
buyers	624	9
willing	625	9
to	626	9
pay	627	9
increasingly	628	9
inflated	629	9
prices	630	9
for	631	9
their	632	9
bulbs.	633	9
As	634	9
this	635	9
realization	636	9
set	637	9
in,	638	9
the	639	9
demand	640	9
for	641	9
tulips	642	9
collapsed,	643	9
and	644	9
prices	645	9
plummeted.	646	9
The	647	9
speculative	648	9
bubble	649	9
burst.	650	9
Some	651	9
were	652	9
left	653	9
holding	654	9
contracts	655	9
to	656	9
purchase	657	9
tulips	658	9
at	659	9
prices	660	9
now	661	9
ten	662	9
times	663	9
greater	664	9
than	665	9
those	666	9
on	667	9
the	668	9
open	669	9
market,	670	9
while	671	9
others	672	9
found	673	9
themselves	674	9
in	675	9
possession	676	9
of	677	9
bulbs	678	9
now	679	9
worth	680	9
a	681	9
fraction	682	9
of	683	9
the	684	9
price	685	9
they	686	9
had	687	9
paid.	688	9
The	689	9
event	690	9
was	691	9
popularized	692	9

Delusions	701	9
and	702	9
the	703	9
Madness	704	9
of	705	9
Crowds',	706	9
that	707	9
a	708	9
British	709	9
journalist	710	9
Charles	711	9
Mackay	712	9
wrote.	713	9
That	714	9
crowds	715	9
of	716	9
people	717	9
often	718	9
behave	719	9
irrationally	720	9
was	721	9
the	722	9
main	723	9
thesis	724	9
of	725	9
the	726	9
book,	727	9
and	728	9
tulip	729	9
mania	730	9
was	731	9
one	732	9
of	733	9
the	734	9
primary	735	9
examples.	736	9
According	737	9
to	738	9
Mackay,	739	9
at	740	9
one	741	9
point	742	9
twelve	743	9
acres	744	9
of	745	9
land	746	9
were	747	9
offered	748	9
for	749	9
a	750	9
Semper	751	9
Augustus	752	9
bulb.	753	9
He	754	9
claims	755	9
that	756	9
many	757	9
such	758	9
investors	759	9
ruined	760	9
by	761	9
the	762	9
fall	763	9
in	764	9
prices	765	9
were	766	9
desperate,	767	9
and	768	9
Dutch	769	9
commerce	770	9
suffered	771	9
a	772	9
severe	773	9
shock.	774	9
In	775	9
Mackay's	776	9
account,	777	9
the	778	9
panicked	779	9
tulip	780	9
speculators	781	9
sought	782	9
help	783	9
from	784	9
the	785	9
government	786	9
of	787	9
the	788	9
Netherlands,	789	9
which	790	9
responded	791	9
by	792	9
declaring	793	9
that	794	9
anyone	795	9
who	796	9
had	797	9
bought	798	9
contracts	799	9
to	800	9
purchase	801	9
bulbs	802	9
in	803	9
the	804	9
future	805	9
could	806	9
void	807	9
their	808	9
contract	809	9
by	810	9
payment	811	9
of	812	9
a	813	9
ten	814	9
percent	815	9
fee.	816	9
Attempts	817	9
that	818	9
were	819	9
made	820	9
to	821	9
resolve	822	9
the	823	9
situation	824	9
to	825	9
the	826	9
satisfaction	827	9
of	828	9
all	829	9
parties	830	9
were	831	9
unsuccessful.	832	9
The	833	9
mania	834	9
finally	835	9
ended,	836	9
Mackay	837	9
says,	838	9
with	839	9
individuals	840	9
stuck	841	9
with	842	9
the	843	9
bulbs	844	9
they	845	9
held	846	9
at	847	9
the	848	9
end	849	9
of	850	9
the	851	9
crash.	852	9
No	853	9
court	854	9
would	855	9
enforce	856	9
payment	857	9
of	858	9
a	859	9
contract,	860	9
since	861	9
judges	862	9
regarded	863	9
the	864	9
debts	865	9
as	866	9
contracted	867	9
through	868	9
gambling,	869	9
and	870	9
thus	871	9
not	872	9
enforceable	873	9
by	874	9
law.	875	9
Although	876	9
Mackay's	877	9
book	878	9
is	879	9
a	880	9
classic	881	9
that	882	9
many	883	9
publishing	884	9
houses	885	9
continue	886	9
reprinting	887	9
today,	888	9
his	889	9
account	890	9
is	891	9
contested.	892	9
Many	893	9
modern	894	9
scholars	895	9
believe	896	9
the	897	9
mania	898	9
was	899	9
not	900	9
as	901	9
extraordinary	902	9
as	903	9
Mackay	904	9
described,	905	9
with	906	9
some	907	9
arguing	908	9
that	909	9
the	910	9
price	911	9
changes	912	9
may	913	9
not	914	9
have	915	9
constituted	916	9
a	917	9
bubble.	918	9
Research	919	9
on	920	9
the	921	9
tulip	922	9
mania	923	9
is	924	9
difficult	925	9
because	926	9
of	927	9
the	928	9
limited	929	9
data	930	9
from	931	9
the	932	9
sixteen	933	9
thirties.	934	9
However,	935	9
some	936	9
modern	937	9
economists	938	9
have	939	9
proposed	940	9
rational	941	9
explanations,	942	9
rather	943	9
than	944	9
a	945	9
speculative	946	9
mania,	947	9
for	948	9
the	949	9
rise	950	9
and	951	9
fall	952	9
in	953	9
prices.	954	9
For	955	9
example,	956	9
other	957	9
flowers,	958	9
such	959	9
as	960	9
the	961	9
hyacinth,	962	9
also	963	9
had	964	9
high	965	9
prices	966	9
on	967	9
the	968	9
flower's	969	9
introduction,	970	9
which	971	9
then	972	9
fell	973	9
dramatically.	974	9
The	975	9
high	976	9
prices	977	9
may	978	9
also	979	9
have	980	9
been	981	9
driven	982	9
by	983	9
expectations	984	9
of	985	9
a	986	9
parliamentary	987	9
decree	988	9
that	989	9
contracts	990	9
could	991	9
be	992	9
voided	993	9
for	994	9
a	995	9
small	996	9
cost,	997	9
thus	998	9
lowering	999	9
the	1000	9
risk	1001	9
to	1002	9
buyers.	1003	9
Despite	1004	9
these	1005	9
disagreements	1006	9
about	1007	9
whether	1008	9
the	1009	9
phenomenon	1010	9
technically	1011	9
constituted	1012	9
an	1013	9
economic	1014	9
bubble,	1015	9
the	1016	9
term	1017	9
'tulip	1018	9
mania'	1019	9
is	1020	9
still	1021	9
often	1022	9
used	1023	9
metaphorically	1024	9
to	1025	9
refer	1026	9
to	1027	9
any	1028	9
large	1029	9
economic	1030	9
bubble,	1031	9
when	1032	9
asset	1033	9
prices	1034	9
deviate	1035	9
from	1036	9
intrinsic	1037	9
values.	1038	9
Tourette's	1	10
syndrome,	2	10
a	3	10
neurological	4	10
disorder	5	10
characterized	6	10
by	7	10
repetitive,	8	10
involuntary	9	10
movements,	10	10
was	11	10
named	12	10
for	13	10
Dr.	14	10
Georges	15	10
Gilles	16	10
de	17	10
la	18	10
Tourette,	19	10
the	20	10
pioneering	21	10
French	22	10
neurologist	23	10
who	24	10
first	25	10
described	26	10
the	27	10
condition	28	10
in	29	10
an	30	10
eighty-six-year-old	31	10
French	32	10
noblewoman.	33	10
It	34	10
is	35	10
almost	36	10
always	37	10
in	38	10
childhood	39	10
that	40	10
the	41	10
early	42	10
symptoms	43	10
of	44	10
Tourette's	45	10
are	46	10
first	47	10
noticed,	48	10
with	49	10
the	50	10
average	51	10
onset	52	10
between	53	10
the	54	10
ages	55	10
of	56	10
seven	57	10
and	58	10
ten	59	10
years.	60	10
It	61	10
is	62	10
estimated	63	10
that	64	10
two	65	10
hundred	66	10
thousand	67	10
Americans	68	10
have	69	10
the	70	10
most	71	10
severe	72	10
form	73	10
of	74	10
Tourette's,	75	10
and	76	10
as	77	10
many	78	10
as	79	10
one	80	10
in	81	10
a	82	10
hundred	83	10
people	84	10
exhibit	85	10
milder	86	10
and	87	10
less	88	10
complex	89	10
symptoms	90	10
that	91	10
include	92	10
chronic	93	10
motor	94	10
and	95	10
vocal	96	10
tics	97	10
or	98	10
transient	99	10
tics	100	10
of	101	10
childhood.	102	10
For	103	10
the	104	10
majority	105	10
of	106	10
people	107	10
diagnosed	108	10
with	109	10
the	110	10
disorder,	111	10
Tourette's	112	10
is	113	10
not	114	10
a	115	10
chronic	116	10
condition	117	10
with	118	10
symptoms	119	10
lasting	120	10
a	121	10
lifetime.	122	10
Rather	123	10
it	124	10
is	125	10
a	126	10
condition	127	10
whose	128	10
severity	129	10
peaks	130	10
in	131	10
the	132	10
early	133	10
teens,	134	10
with	135	10
improvement	136	10
occurring	137	10
in	138	10
the	139	10
late	140	10
teens	141	10
and	142	10
continuing	143	10
into	144	10
adulthood.	145	10
However,	146	10
approximately	147	10
ten	148	10
percent	149	10
of	150	10
those	151	10
affected	152	10
have	153	10
a	154	10
progressive	155	10
or	156	10
disabling	157	10
course	158	10
that	159	10
lasts	160	10
into	161	10
adulthood.	162	10
It	163	10
is	164	10
not	165	10
uncommon	166	10
for	167	10
symptoms	168	10
to	169	10
be	170	10
present	171	10
for	172	10
an	173	10
extended	174	10
period	175	10
of	176	10
time	177	10
before	178	10
a	179	10
formal	180	10
diagnosis	181	10
of	182	10
Tourette's	183	10
is	184	10
obtained.	185	10
The	186	10
reasons	187	10
for	188	10
this	189	10
are	190	10
many	191	10
and	192	10
may	193	10
include	194	10
the	195	10
fact	196	10
that	197	10
for	198	10
families	199	10
and	200	10
physicians	201	10
unfamiliar	202	10
with	203	10
Tourette's,	204	10
mild	205	10
and	206	10
even	207	10
moderate	208	10
tic	209	10
symptoms	210	10
may	211	10
be	212	10
considered	213	10
inconsequential,	214	10
part	215	10
of	216	10
a	217	10
developmental	218	10
phase,	219	10
or	220	10
the	221	10
result	222	10
of	223	10
another	224	10
condition.	225	10
For	226	10
example,	227	10
parents	228	10
may	229	10
think	230	10
that	231	10
eye	232	10
blinking	233	10
is	234	10
related	235	10
to	236	10
vision	237	10
problems	238	10
or	239	10
that	240	10
sniffing	241	10
is	242	10
related	243	10
to	244	10
seasonal	245	10
allergies.	246	10
There	247	10
are	248	10
many	249	10
patients	250	10
who	251	10
are	252	10
self-diagnosed	253	10
after	254	10
they,	255	10
their	256	10
parents,	257	10
other	258	10
relatives,	259	10
or	260	10
friends	261	10
read	262	10
or	263	10
hear	264	10
about	265	10
Tourette's	266	10
from	267	10
others.	268	10
Tics	269	10
are	270	10
classified	271	10
as	272	10
either	273	10
simple	274	10
or	275	10
complex.	276	10
Simple	277	10
motor	278	10
tics	279	10
are	280	10
sudden,	281	10
brief,	282	10
repetitive	283	10
movements	284	10
that	285	10
involve	286	10
a	287	10
limited	288	10
number	289	10
of	290	10
muscle	291	10
groups.	292	10
Some	293	10
of	294	10
the	295	10
more	296	10
common	297	10
simple	298	10
tics	299	10
include	300	10
eye	301	10
blinking,	302	10
facial	303	10
grimacing,	304	10
shoulder	305	10
shrugging,	306	10
and	307	10
head	308	10
or	309	10
shoulder	310	10
jerking.	311	10
Simple	312	10
vocalizations,	313	10
which	314	10
motor	315	10
tics	316	10
typically	317	10
precede,	318	10
might	319	10
include	320	10
repetitive	321	10
throat-clearing,	322	10
sniffing,	323	10
or	324	10
grunting	325	10
sounds.	326	10
Complex	327	10
tics	328	10
are	329	10
distinct,	330	10
coordinated	331	10
patterns	332	10
of	333	10
movement	334	10
that	335	10
involve	336	10
several	337	10
muscle	338	10
groups.	339	10
Complex	340	10
motor	341	10
tics	342	10
might	343	10
include	344	10
facial	345	10
grimacing	346	10
combined	347	10
with	348	10
a	349	10
head	350	10
twist	351	10
and	352	10
a	353	10
shoulder	354	10
shrug.	355	10
Other	356	10
complex	357	10
motor	358	10
tics	359	10
may	360	10
actually	361	10
appear	362	10
purposeful,	363	10
including	364	10
sniffing	365	10
or	366	10
touching	367	10
objects,	368	10
hopping,	369	10
jumping,	370	10
bending,	371	10
or	372	10
twisting.	373	10
Complex	374	10
vocal	375	10
tics	376	10
include	377	10
words	378	10
or	379	10
phrases.	380	10
Perhaps	381	10
the	382	10
most	383	10
dramatic	384	10
and	385	10
disabling	386	10
tics	387	10
include	388	10
motor	389	10
movements	390	10
that	391	10
result	392	10
in	393	10
self-harm	394	10
such	395	10
as	396	10
punching	397	10
oneself	398	10
in	399	10
the	400	10
face,	401	10
or	402	10
vocal	403	10
tics	404	10
including	405	10
coprolalia,	406	10
which	407	10
involves	408	10
uttering	409	10
swear	410	10
words,	411	10
or	412	10
echolalia,	413	10
which	414	10
involves	415	10
repeating	416	10
the	417	10
words	418	10
or	419	10
phrases	420	10
of	421	10
others.	422	10
Tics	423	10
are	424	10
often	425	10
worse	426	10
with	427	10
excitement	428	10
or	429	10
anxiety	430	10
and	431	10
better	432	10
during	433	10
calm,	434	10
focused	435	10
activities.	436	10
Certain	437	10
physical	438	10
experiences	439	10
can	440	10
trigger	441	10
or	442	10
worsen	443	10
tics.	444	10
For	445	10
example,	446	10
tight	447	10
collars	448	10
may	449	10
trigger	450	10
neck	451	10
tics,	452	10
or	453	10
hearing	454	10
another	455	10
person	456	10
sniff	457	10
or	458	10
throat-clear	459	10
may	460	10
trigger	461	10
the	462	10
production	463	10
of	464	10
similar	465	10
sounds.	466	10
Tics	467	10
come	468	10
and	469	10
go	470	10
over	471	10
time,	472	10
varying	473	10
in	474	10
type,	475	10
frequency,	476	10
location,	477	10
and	478	10
severity.	479	10
The	480	10
first	481	10
symptoms	482	10
Tourette's	483	10
patients	484	10
experience	485	10
usually	486	10
occur	487	10
in	488	10
the	489	10
head	490	10
and	491	10
neck	492	10
area,	493	10
though	494	10
they	495	10
may	496	10
progress	497	10
to	498	10
include	499	10
muscles	500	10
of	501	10
the	502	10
trunk	503	10
and	504	10
extremities.	505	10
The	506	10
symptoms	507	10
of	508	10
Tourette's	509	10
are	510	10
involuntary,	511	10
but	512	10
there	513	10
are	514	10
some	515	10
people	516	10
who	517	10
can	518	10
sometimes	519	10
suppress,	520	10
camouflage,	521	10
or	522	10
otherwise	523	10
manage	524	10
their	525	10
tics	526	10
in	527	10
an	528	10
effort	529	10
to	530	10
minimize	531	10
their	532	10
impact	533	10
on	534	10
functioning.	535	10
However,	536	10
people	537	10
affected	538	10
by	539	10
Tourette's	540	10
often	541	10
report	542	10
a	543	10
substantial	544	10
buildup	545	10
in	546	10
tension	547	10
when	548	10
suppressing	549	10
their	550	10
tics	551	10
to	552	10
the	553	10
point	554	10
where	555	10
they	556	10
often	557	10
feel	558	10
that	559	10
the	560	10
tic	561	10
must	562	10
be	563	10
expressed.	564	10
Tics	565	10
in	566	10
response	567	10
to	568	10
an	569	10
environmental	570	10
trigger	571	10
can	572	10
appear	573	10
to	574	10
be	575	10
voluntary	576	10
or	577	10
purposeful,	578	10
but	579	10
are	580	10
not.	581	10
Many	582	10
people	583	10
with	584	10
Tourette's	585	10
experience	586	10
additional	587	10
neurobehavioral	588	10
problems	589	10
that	590	10
include	591	10
inattention,	592	10
hyperactivity	593	10
and	594	10
impulsivity.	595	10
People	596	10
with	597	10
Tourette's	598	10
have	599	10
also	600	10
reported	601	10
problems	602	10
with	603	10
depression	604	10
or	605	10
anxiety	606	10
disorders,	607	10
as	608	10
well	609	10
as	610	10
other	611	10
difficulties	612	10
Tourette's	613	10
syndrome	614	10
may	615	10
or	616	10
may	617	10
not	618	10
directly	619	10
cause.	620	10
Tourette's	621	10
is	622	10
a	623	10
diagnosis	624	10
doctors	625	10
make	626	10
after	627	10
verifying	628	10
that	629	10
the	630	10
patient	631	10
has	632	10
had	633	10
both	634	10
motor	635	10
and	636	10
vocal	637	10
tics	638	10
for	639	10
at	640	10
least	641	10
one	642	10
year.	643	10
The	644	10
existence	645	10
of	646	10
other	647	10
neurological	648	10
or	649	10
psychiatric	650	10
conditions	651	10
can	652	10
also	653	10
help	654	10
doctors	655	10
establish	656	10
the	657	10
diagnosis	658	10
of	659	10
Tourette's	660	10
is	661	10
the	662	10
correct	663	10
one.	664	10
Knowledgeable	665	10
clinicians	666	10
consulted	667	10
by	668	10
patients	669	10
do	670	10
not	671	10
often	672	10
misdiagnose	673	10
common	674	10
tics.	675	10
However,	676	10
atypical	677	10
symptoms	678	10
or	679	10
atypical	680	10
presentation	681	10
such	682	10
as	683	10
onset	684	10
of	685	10
symptoms	686	10
in	687	10
adulthood	688	10
may	689	10
require	690	10
specialty	691	10
expertise	692	10
for	693	10
diagnosis.	694	10
There	695	10
are	696	10
no	697	10
blood	698	10
or	699	10
laboratory	700	10
tests	701	10
needed	702	10
for	703	10
diagnosis.	704	10
However,	705	10
neuroimaging	706	10
studies,	707	10
which	708	10
include	709	10
magnetic	710	10
resonance	711	10
imaging,	712	10
computerized	713	10
tomography,	714	10
and	715	10
electroencephalograms,	716	10
as	717	10
well	718	10
as	719	10
certain	720	10
lab	721	10
tests	722	10
may	723	10
be	724	10
used	725	10
to	726	10
rule	727	10
out	728	10
other	729	10
conditions	730	10
that	731	10
Tourette's	732	10
might	733	10
be	734	10
confused	735	10
with.	736	10
In	737	10
terms	738	10
of	739	10
the	740	10
role	741	10
of	742	10
genes	743	10
in	744	10
the	745	10
disorder,	746	10
evidence	747	10
from	748	10
twin	749	10
and	750	10
family	751	10
studies	752	10
suggests	753	10
that	754	10
Tourette's	755	10
is	756	10
an	757	10
inherited	758	10
disorder.	759	10
Although	760	10
early	761	10
family	762	10
studies	763	10
suggested	764	10
an	765	10
autosomal	766	10
dominant	767	10
mode	768	10
of	769	10
inheritance	770	10
characterized	771	10
the	772	10
condition,	773	10
more	774	10
recent	775	10
studies	776	10
discovered	777	10
the	778	10
pattern	779	10
of	780	10
inheritance	781	10
was	782	10
much	783	10
more	784	10
complex.	785	10
Although	786	10
there	787	10
may	788	10
be	789	10
a	790	10
few	791	10
genes	792	10
that	793	10
have	794	10
substantial	795	10
effects,	796	10
it's	797	10
also	798	10
possible	799	10
that	800	10
many	801	10
genes	802	10
with	803	10
smaller	804	10
effects	805	10
and	806	10
environmental	807	10
factors	808	10
may	809	10
play	810	10
a	811	10
role	812	10
in	813	10
the	814	10
development	815	10
of	816	10
Tourette's.	817	10
Genetic	818	10
studies	819	10
also	820	10
suggest	821	10
that	822	10
some	823	10
forms	824	10
of	825	10
Attention	826	10
Deficit	827	10
Hyperactivity	828	10
Disorder	829	10
and	830	10
Obsessive	831	10
Compulsive	832	10
Disorder	833	10
are	834	10
genetically	835	10
related	836	10
to	837	10
Tourette's,	838	10
but	839	10
there	840	10
is	841	10
less	842	10
evidence	843	10
for	844	10
a	845	10
genetic	846	10
relationship	847	10
between	848	10
Tourette's	849	10
and	850	10
other	851	10
neurobehavioral	852	10
problems	853	10
that	854	10
Tourette's	855	10
commonly	856	10
co-occurs	857	10
with.	858	10
An	859	10
important	860	10
role	861	10
in	862	10
Tourette's	863	10
gene	864	10
expression	865	10
is	866	10
played	867	10
by	868	10
the	869	10
sex	870	10
of	871	10
the	872	10
person.	873	10
In	874	10
particular,	875	10
males	876	10
affected	877	10
by	878	10
the	879	10
gene	880	10
are	881	10
more	882	10
likely	883	10
to	884	10
have	885	10
tics	886	10
and	887	10
females	888	10
who	889	10
have	890	10
a	891	10
genetic	892	10
predisposition	893	10
are	894	10
more	895	10
likely	896	10
to	897	10
have	898	10
obsessive-compulsive	899	10
symptoms.	900	10
Much	901	10
current	902	10
research	903	10
is	904	10
aimed	905	10
at	906	10
better	907	10
understanding	908	10
the	909	10
genetic	910	10
basis	911	10
and	912	10
symptomology	913	10
of	914	10
Tourette's,	915	10
as	916	10
well	917	10
as	918	10
its	919	10
relationship	920	10
to	921	10
related	922	10
disorders.	923	10
The	924	10
hope	925	10
is	926	10
that	927	10
this	928	10
research	929	10
leads	930	10
to	931	10
better	932	10
diagnostic	933	10
tools	934	10
and	935	10
better	936	10
treatments	937	10
for	938	10
Tourette's.	939	10
